  "summary": "Parliament advanced key fiscal and climate policy matters in Thursday’s sitting, including the passage of Part 2 amendments to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2024–25, Emergency Response, and Remedial Measures) Bill, and the signing of funding and policy directions across health, transport, and climate resilience. Ministers faced pointed questions on living wages, foreign investment rules, and private-sector approaches to public services, while a cross-party inquiry laid out a long-term climate adaptation framework. The day culminated with debate on crypto-asset reporting and the rapid evolution of platform-based taxation rules.",

      "content": "Parliament advanced Part 2 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2024–25, Emergency Response, and Remedial Measures) Bill, detailing a 50% uplift in employee share scheme thresholds (CW 26C(2): from $5,000 to $7,500 and from $2,000 to $3,000) and introducing new emergency deduction rules (DB 69) to cover interruptions from emergencies. The government defended the move as practical and inflation-aware, arguing it supports growth in start-ups and aligns with disaster-response efficiency, while critics pressed for clarity on inflation offsets and nexus to income. The Finance and Expenditure Committee also examined platform-economy GST changes ( Clauses 14, 23, 29) and remedial partnership definitions (Clauses 31–32) as part of this package before agreeing to the amendments.",
