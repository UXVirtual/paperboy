Debates on major reforms to resource management and water services also featured prominently, underscoring a day of significant policy clashes between the government and opposition parties.",

        "content": "The Prime Minister faced a sustained barrage of questions from the Opposition regarding the cost of living and the number of New Zealanders leaving for Australia. Leader of the Opposition Chris Hipkins challenged the government's economic record, pointing to rising costs and claiming 184,000 Kiwis had left since the government took office. The Prime Minister defended his government's actions, blaming the previous administration for high inflation and interest rates, and highlighted policies like the expansion of the FamilyBoost childcare subsidy and tax relief as key measures to support working families.",

Because why are they leaving? They're leaving because there was high inflation, high interest rates, the economy shrunk, and people were put out of work. And that was because of the last Government."

The bill introduces a new test to determine whether a worker is a contractor or an employee, a move opponents claim will undermine the rights of gig economy workers like Uber drivers. It also establishes a $180,000 income threshold above which employees cannot pursue personal grievances for unjustified dismissal, and removes the '30-day rule' that gives new employees the terms of a collective agreement for their first month.

The Online Casino Gambling Bill, introduced by Minister Brooke van Velden, seeks to create a regulated market by licensing up to 15 online casino operators. The government argues this will bring an unregulated industry into the light, introducing harm minimisation measures and generating tax revenue. However, the proposal was met with strong opposition from Labour, the Greens, and Te Pāti Māori, who argued that licensing 15 operators was far too many and would lead to a saturation of advertising and an increase in gambling harm, particularly in vulnerable communities.",
