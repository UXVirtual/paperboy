The day also saw a contentious debate on a bill to remove advertising restrictions on public holidays, and a Green MP delivered an emotional valedictory speech, resigning due to threats against their family.",

      "content": "The Minister for Economic Growth, Nicola Willis, faced intense questioning from Labour's Damien O'Connor after official figures revealed the economy shrank by 0.9% in the latest quarter. O'Connor challenged the Minister on her government's performance, citing a 9.4% decline in construction and comparing New Zealand's negative growth to positive results in Australia, Japan, and the UK. Minister Willis defended her record, pointing to 0.8% growth in the first quarter of the year and stating she could not take responsibility for decisions made by the previous government but was focused on 'fixing it'.",

      "content": "The Broadcasting (Repeal of Advertising Restrictions) Amendment Bill was debated in the committee of the whole House, passing without amendment. The bill repeals a section of the 1989 Broadcasting Act that prohibits advertising on TV and radio on Christmas Day, Good Friday, Easter Sunday, and Anzac Day morning. The Government, represented by Hon Chris Penk, argued the change was necessary to create fairness and consistency for traditional broadcasters competing with online platforms where no such restrictions exist. Labour and Green MPs questioned the bill's effectiveness, arguing the estimated $6 million in extra revenue was a minor solution to the media sector's major financial crisis and raising concerns about the commercialisation of sacred days.",
