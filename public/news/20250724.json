    "publicationDate": "2025-07-24",
    "summary": "Parliament was consumed by heated debates on the rising cost of living and a deepening homelessness crisis, with the Government facing intense scrutiny over its social and economic policies. Ministers defended their actions on food prices, emergency housing, and education funding against a barrage of criticism from opposition parties who pointed to growing hardship in communities across the country. The session also saw a fiery exchange over the official use of the name 'Aotearoa' and the third reading of a major bill aimed at tackling international cyber-crime.",

        "content": "The cost of living crisis was front and centre during Question Time, with Finance Minister Nicola Willis defending the Government's record against accusations of worsening food insecurity. Labour's Barbara Edmonds cited reports from social service providers of unprecedented demand, questioning the Government's claim that costs were getting under control. Willis countered by pointing to a significant drop in the rate of food price inflation since the Government took office, attributing high electricity prices to the previous administration's ban on oil and gas exploration. The exchanges highlighted the deep divide on whether government policies are easing or exacerbating financial pressure on New Zealand households.",

The Greens' Tamatha Paul and Labour's Kieran McAnulty confronted Associate Housing Minister Tama Potaka with data from a new Homelessness Insights report and testimony from front-line providers like the Auckland City Mission. They attributed the increase to the Government's decision to restrict access to emergency housing, noting a sharp rise in declined applications. Potaka defended the policy changes, stating the previous system created dangerous and squalid living conditions in motels and that the Government is focused on providing more targeted, enduring support.",

The bill, which amends several laws including the Search and Surveillance Act, gives law enforcement new tools like 'preservation directions' to prevent the deletion of digital evidence. While supported by National, Labour, ACT, NZ First, and the Greens, Te Pāti Māori opposed it, citing risks to Māori data sovereignty. Labour and the Greens also raised significant concerns about potential human rights infringements, the lack of judicial oversight for some new powers, and the risk of enabling foreign governments to target political dissidents in New Zealand.",

Education Minister Erica Stanford was challenged on how a 1% annual pay offer over three years aligns with the Government's stated goal to \"back and strengthen\" educators, especially with inflation at 2.7%. The Minister defended the offer as a \"reasonable first offer\" that was \"carefully crafted\" to be affordable for taxpayers, while highlighting other Government support for the workforce, including professional development and paying registration fees. She also pointed to a 30% increase in domestic enrolments for initial teacher education as a sign that people want to be part of the system under the current government.",
