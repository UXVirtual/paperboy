      "content": "A heated discussion centred on repealing Section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act, with Green Party amendments arguing for stronger obligations to reduce disparities for Māori and to preserve Te Tiriti principles. Labour MPs pressed back, arguing the Chief Executive should not be bound by race-based requirements and that existing reporting mechanisms suffice. The debate highlighted tensions over how to safeguard Māori wellbeing in state care, with calls to retain strategic partnerships and reporting duties. The day concluded with parts of the bill advancing and ongoing committee consideration scheduled for future sessions.",

Labour emphasised that the changes are about monitoring and safeguarding children, not creating new offences, while opponents argued that retrospective provisions will apply to those already on the register.

Proponents argued that greater competition would reduce costs and spur innovation, while opponents warned of potential dominance by large importers and potential implications for local manufacturers.
