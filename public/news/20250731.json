    "publicationDate": "2025-07-31",
    "summary": "Parliament was dominated by the final passage of the controversial Crown Minerals Amendment Bill, officially repealing the 2018 ban on new offshore oil and gas exploration. The Government also introduced major reforms to the public service, while facing intense questioning over the cost of living and low pay offers for nurses and teachers during a heated Question Time.",

        "content": "The Government successfully passed the third and final reading of the Crown Minerals Amendment Bill, officially reversing the previous government's 2018 ban on new petroleum exploration permits outside of onshore Taranaki. Proponents, led by Minister for Energy Simon Watts, argued the move is critical for New Zealand's energy security, will attract investment, and will prevent reliance on higher-emission imported coal. The Opposition fiercely contested the bill, with Labour's Dr Megan Woods and the Green Party's Steve Abel arguing it undermines climate change commitments, risks trade agreements, and offers a false solution to energy affordability, labelling it an ideological move that benefits multinational corporations over New Zealanders.",

It shouts loud and clear that that is where their priorities lie. They will put oil and gas corporations ahead of New Zealand taxpayers every day of the week, and this bill lays that out in black and white."

This bill replaces ideology with evidence—imagine that—it ends six years of economic damage from Labour's damaging economic policies, and it tells the world that New Zealand is once again open for investment."

Minister for the Public Service Judith Collins stated the bill restores purpose and discipline by strengthening merit-based appointments, making chief executive reappointments contestable, and removing specific provisions for diversity, equity, and inclusion, arguing these are covered by other laws. Labour and the Greens strongly opposed the bill, raising concerns that it politicises the public service, weakens pay equity commitments, and rolls back progress on creating a workforce that reflects New Zealand society.",

It is shocking and, I think, a terrible thing to include that within a bill that could have been an opportunity to really move the Public Service forward."
