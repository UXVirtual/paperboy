        "content": "The Government's contentious Crown Minerals Amendment Bill passed its third and final reading, officially repealing the 2018 ban on new petroleum exploration permits outside of onshore Taranaki. The Government argued the move is essential for New Zealand's energy security and affordability, claiming the ban had a 'chilling effect' on investment and led to greater reliance on imported coal. Opposition parties vehemently opposed the bill, arguing it is a regressive step that undermines climate change commitments, risks trade agreements, and gambles taxpayer money on a dying industry, promising to reinstate the ban if returned to power.",

Key changes include removing specific provisions for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), arguing they are covered by other laws, and making all chief executive reappointments subject to a competitive process rather than being automatic. The Government stated the reforms are about restoring discipline, ensuring merit-based appointments, and delivering value for taxpayers. The Opposition countered that the bill takes New Zealand backwards, undermines pay equity commitments, and risks politicising the public service.",
