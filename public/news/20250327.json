      "content": "The House progressed the Privacy Amendment Bill, with Part 1 establishing a new information privacy principle (IPP 3A) to regulate indirect collection of personal information and outlining practical exemptions (including GLAM sector considerations). An amendment paper extends the commencement of IPP 3A to 1 May 2026 to give agencies time to prepare, and Part 2 covers additional, technical amendments. The bill was reported back with amendments, setting the stage for further consideration. The measures aim to strengthen privacy protections while reducing administrative burdens for agencies.",

      "content": "The Building (Overseas Building Products, Standards, and Certification Schemes) Amendment Bill moved to a second reading, with the Government arguing it will boost competition, resilience, and choice in the building sector. The bill allows recognition of overseas standards and certification schemes by notice, streamlines the citing of international standards, and introduces building product specifications. It also requires building consent authorities to accept overseas-certified products where appropriate, with regulations to roll out these changes progressively to avoid compromising safety and quality.",

Henare apologised for stepping onto the floor during the vote, and the committee recommended an apology to the House, which has since been delivered. The motion to note the report was agreed to, marking the matter as concluded for the House.",

      "content": "The Child Protection (Child Sex Offender Government Agency Registration) Amendment Bill entered its second reading. The bill adds seven qualifying offences to the register and tightens reporting requirements, including earlier notification of residence changes (48 hours before a child resides at a given address) and overseas travel notifications. It also contemplates retrospective administrative changes, which the Attorney-General has identified as inconsistent with NZBORA, though proponents argue the changes are necessary for risk management and child safety. The debate highlighted concerns about retroactivity and the balance between victims’ protections and offenders’ rights as the bill progresses.",

      "content": "Questions to the Minister of Local Government centered on Standard & Poor’s downgrade of 18 councils and three council-controlled organisations. The Government defended its approach, emphasizing Local Water Done Well and increased financing tools via the Local Government Funding Agency (LGFA). S&P had affirmed LGFA ratings, while other commentary suggested policy changes contributed to downgrades. The exchange underscored tensions over central-local government financial risk and the government’s strategy to restore council credit quality and public service delivery.",

The Government signaled continued work to improve competition in New Zealand’s grocery market, including potential new entrants and reduced barriers to entry, while noting that the Commerce Commission would continue its wholesale inquiry and land banking analysis as part of its second grocery report.",
