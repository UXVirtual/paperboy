    "publicationDate": "2025-04-03",
    "summary": "Parliament was marked by deep ideological divides as the Government passed its controversial bill to repeal section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act after a fiery final debate. In contrast, a bill to modernise the Anzac Day Act received unanimous support in its first reading, while Question Time saw sharp exchanges over a multi-million dollar subsidy for the Tīwai Point aluminium smelter.",

        "content": "The highly contentious Oranga Tamariki (Repeal of Section 7AA) Amendment Bill has passed its third and final reading, backed by the coalition government parties. The bill removes the clause requiring Oranga Tamariki to prioritise a child's whakapapa and cultural connections in decision-making. The Government argued the repeal is necessary to ensure a child's safety and wellbeing are the paramount considerations, free from any confusion. Opposition parties fiercely opposed the bill, arguing it breaches Te Tiriti o Waitangi, removes vital cultural protections that keep tamariki Māori safe, and ignores the voices of survivors of state care abuse. Despite heated debate, the bill passed 68 to 54.",

I frankly cannot understand the Opposition opposing this."

The Anzac Day Amendment Bill aims to broaden the scope of commemoration to formally include New Zealanders who have served in conflicts and peacekeeping missions since the Vietnam War. The changes will also recognise non-military personnel who served in warlike conflicts, such as medical staff and the merchant navy, as well as allied forces. While supporting the bill, members from Labour, the Green Party, and Te Pāti Māori also called for explicit recognition of those who fought and died in the New Zealand Wars of the 19th century.",

Climate Change Minister Simon Watts argued the decision was crucial for protecting regional jobs and represented a saving of over $100 million per year compared to the subsidy the smelter would have automatically received. The Green Party's Scott Willis challenged the move, labelling it 'corporate welfare' and questioning its fairness as households face rising power bills.

The Government says the change is designed to improve access to justice, providing a faster and cheaper forum for resolving civil disputes that are too costly to take to the District Court. A new filing fee of $468 will be introduced for claims over $30,000. While supporting the bill's intent, Labour and the Greens raised concerns about the size of the new fee and the lack of an appeal process for potentially life-changing sums, arguing more safeguards are needed.",
