    "summary": "Parliament was dominated by a major foreign policy debate on the escalating Middle East crisis, with the Government defending its diplomatic approach against Opposition calls to condemn US military action. Domestically, fierce exchanges erupted over the cost of living and the exclusion of Treaty of Waitangi principles from a new standards bill. The day also saw the introduction of significant new legislation aimed at overhauling overseas investment and immigration rules.",

The Opposition, led by Chris Hipkins, argued the strikes are illegal under international law and that New Zealand has a duty to speak out, drawing parallels to the 2003 Iraq invasion. The Green Party's Marama Davidson went further, condemning the US strikes and calling for the New Zealand Government to do the same, leading to a heated exchange.",
