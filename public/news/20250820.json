    "publicationDate": "2025-08-20",
    "summary": "The Reserve Bank's decision to cut the official cash rate to 3 percent dominated a tense day in Parliament, providing potential relief for mortgage holders but sparking fierce debate over the Government's economic management. The day also saw heated exchanges over ongoing teachers' strikes, while two significant member's bills aimed at protecting family violence victims and banning pay secrecy in workplaces passed their final readings.",

        "content": "The Government hailed the Reserve Bank's decision to lower the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 3 percent as a major win for the economy. Minister of Finance Nicola Willis announced the move would deliver much-needed cost-of-living relief, projecting that a family with a $500,000 floating mortgage would save around $330 a fortnight. However, Labour's Barbara Edmonds challenged the Government's narrative of an economic recovery, pointing to a 56.6% increase in KiwiSaver hardship withdrawals and a 37% rise in company liquidations as signs of ongoing struggle for households and businesses.",

That is a far cry from the 5.5 percent cash rate reached in May 2023. Over the past year, OCR reductions have lowered the cost of borrowing for New Zealand households and businesses, delivering much-needed cost of living relief and supporting the economic recovery."
