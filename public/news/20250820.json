    "summary": "Parliament was dominated by major economic news as the Reserve Bank cut the Official Cash Rate, offering relief to mortgage holders. However, the announcement was set against a backdrop of intense political clashes over ongoing teacher strikes, the costly final settlement for the cancelled KiwiRail ferry project, and rising unemployment for Pasifika communities.",

        "topic": "Reserve Bank Slashes OCR to 3%, Offering Mortgage Relief",
        "content": "Minister of Finance Hon Nicola Willis announced the Reserve Bank has cut the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 3%, its lowest level in three years. She celebrated the news, stating it would provide significant cost-of-living relief, with a family holding a $500,000 floating mortgage saving around $330 a fortnight. The Reserve Bank also signalled two more potential cuts this year. The announcement was challenged by Labour's Hon Barbara Edmonds, who questioned the government's economic recovery narrative by pointing to a 56.6% increase in KiwiSaver hardship withdrawals, totalling over $470 million, and a 37% rise in company liquidations.",

        "content": "Prime Minister Rt Hon Christopher Luxon faced sharp questioning from Green Co-leader Hon Marama Davidson regarding nationwide teacher strikes. Davidson highlighted that teachers were striking over a 1% pay offer while inflation sits at 2.7%, and noted that at least 65,000 essential workers had taken industrial action this year alone. Luxon urged unions to negotiate rather than strike, stating his government was working to get wage growth ahead of inflation, a contrast he drew with the previous administration. In a separate exchange, Minister of Education Hon Erica Stanford defended the government's position, arguing that investments in teacher registration fees and learning support demonstrated that teachers are valued.",

Peters heavily criticised the previous government's handling of the project, stating it had already cost $671 million with little to show for it and was projected to escalate to $4 billion. He described the original project's plans, which included new terminal buildings, as \"nonsense\" and \"Taj Mahals in Picton,\" asserting the government's new \"no-nonsense\" solution would save taxpayers billions.",

Sepuloni stated that 6,100 more Pasifika people are now unemployed compared to last year and that the rate has doubled since the government took office. Upston acknowledged Pasifika are disproportionately affected and defended the government's focus on economic growth and programmes like community coaching. She also defended cutting $22 million from the Tupu Aotearoa programme, stating the funds were moved to the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to leverage stronger, existing programmes.",
