    "publicationDate": "2025-08-20",
    "summary": "Parliament was dominated by major economic news as the Reserve Bank cut the official cash rate to 3 percent, aiming to provide relief to households and businesses. The day also saw significant legislative progress, with a landmark pay transparency bill passing its final reading despite opposition from two government coalition partners. Tensions over public sector pay continued, with teacher strikes forming a contentious backdrop to Question Time debates on the cost of living and industrial relations.",

        "content": "Finance Minister Nicola Willis announced that the Reserve Bank has cut the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 3%, its lowest level in three years. Willis hailed the move as delivering much-needed cost of living relief, stating it would save a family with a $500,000 mortgage around $330 a fortnight. The Reserve Bank is also signalling two further cuts this year. The government's economic narrative was challenged by Labour's Barbara Edmonds, who pointed to a 56.6% increase in KiwiSaver hardship withdrawals and a 37% rise in company liquidations as signs that the recovery is not being felt by all.",
