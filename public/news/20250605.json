    "publicationDate": "2025-06-05",
    "summary": "Parliament was consumed by a bitter and historic debate that culminated in the suspension of three Te Pāti Māori MPs for performing a haka during a vote on the controversial Treaty Principles Bill. The unprecedented disciplinary action, passed along partisan lines, overshadowed a day of contentious questioning on the government's policies, including significant changes to pay equity, speed limits near schools, and national freshwater regulations.",

        "topic": "Te Pāti Māori MPs Suspended Following Haka Protest",
        "content": "The House voted to suspend three Te Pāti Māori MPs following a recommendation from the Privileges Committee, which found their performance of a haka during a vote on the Treaty Principles Bill constituted contempt of Parliament. The Government-majority committee recommended an unprecedented suspension of 21 days for co-leaders Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, and 7 days for Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke. The decision broke with the committee's tradition of consensus, with all opposition parties arguing the punishment was disproportionate, vindictive, and set a dangerous precedent for silencing dissent. The ensuing debate saw Te Pāti Māori defend their actions as a legitimate response to a bill they described as 'political violence', while Government members argued the issue was about upholding parliamentary rules and respect for democratic process, not the haka itself. Failed amendments from Labour and the Green Party sought lesser penalties before the suspensions were ultimately confirmed by a party-line vote.",

I think it's really important to put on the record why we concluded that, whilst there was a contempt of the House, we can't agree with the sanctions proposed by the majority."

Labour's Barbara Edmonds read emotional testimony from library and aged-care workers who felt their fight for fair wages had been stripped away. In response, Associate Finance Minister Chris Bishop insisted the government values the workers but needed to make the scheme 'fairer and more affordable'. Labour's Jan Tinetti also challenged the Minister for Women, via proxy, on why her ministry was not consulted on the changes despite the Minister knowing about them for six months.",
