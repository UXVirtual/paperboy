        "content": "The government unveiled its first major investment under the Defence Capability Plan, announcing a $2.7 billion procurement of new aircraft. The deal includes five MH-60R Seahawk helicopters to replace the navy's aging Seasprite fleet and two Airbus A321XLR aircraft to succeed the 32-year-old Boeing 757s. Defence Minister Judith Collins framed the purchase as a \"once-in-a-generation\" investment in national security, enhancing combat capability and ensuring interoperability with allies like Australia and the United States. The new aircraft are intended to improve surveillance, transport, and long-range operational capacity, including for missions to Antarctica.",

I was delighted to announce that the MH-60R Seahawk is the preferred option to replace the existing maritime helicopters, and that the Airbus A321XLR aircraft will replace the ageing 757 fleet. These represent once-in-a-generation investments in our national security to ensure our economic prosperity."

This is not a capability that we've ever had before... They will be able to also fly as far as Singapore without needing to stop and refuel. It's a decision that reflects the need for New Zealand to have a reliable aircraft for our personnel, to deliver military equipment and humanitarian aid, support the evacuation of civilians, and transport Government trade and diplomat delegations quickly over long distances, often at short notice."

        "content": "During a fiery Question Time, Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety Brooke van Velden faced intense scrutiny from Labour's Deputy Leader Carmel Sepuloni over the government's changes to the pay equity system. Sepuloni argued that the changes would force 180,000 workers, mostly women, to bear the cost of the government's budget decisions and would particularly disadvantage Pasifika women and wāhine Māori. Van Velden defended the policy, stating the pay equity system remains intact and that the changes simply ensure it targets genuine cases of sex-based discrimination, denying that any costs were being passed on to workers.",

The legislation is designed to accelerate land acquisition for critical infrastructure projects by streamlining the objections process and offering financial incentives for early agreement, removing most cases from the Environment Court. While the government and Labour supported the bill as a necessary step to address the country's infrastructure deficit, Te Pāti Māori and the Green Party voted against it. Opponents raised serious concerns about the historical use of the Public Works Act to confiscate Māori land and argued the bill strips property rights from everyday New Zealanders.",

The bill would make such actions punishable by up to three months in jail or a $2,000 fine. The government argued the law is a reasonable limitation needed to protect the privacy and safety of individuals and their families from intimidation. However, Labour, the Greens, and Te Pāti Māori strongly opposed the bill, framing it as an attack on the fundamental democratic right to protest and arguing that existing laws for trespass and disorderly behaviour are sufficient.",

The bill extends the lifespan of carbon credits and allows them to be traded between new and used importers, aiming to prevent higher car prices due to importers failing to meet emission targets. Opposition parties heavily criticised the move, with Labour calling it a \"shocker\" that weakens climate commitments to benefit industry.
