The $2.7 billion commitment will see the replacement of the ageing Seasprite helicopter fleet with five new MH-60R Seahawk maritime helicopters, a model also used by key allies like Australia and the United States. Additionally, the 32-year-old Boeing 757 fleet will be replaced by two Airbus A321XLR aircraft, which offer greatly extended range and the crucial ability to safely return from Antarctica if unable to land.",

The RBNZ noted that while domestic demand remains subdued, the export sector is performing well. It forecasts the economy to resume growing, with unemployment peaking at 5.3% and inflation expected to fall quickly towards the 2% midpoint, partly crediting the Government's reduced spending for easing inflationary pressure.",

Sepuloni accused the Minister of undermining women's pay, highlighting that Pasifika women earn almost half a million dollars less than a Pākehā man over a lifetime and that 33 pay equity claims have been cancelled. Van Velden strongly refuted the claims, insisting the pay equity system remains to address \"genuine cases of sex-based discrimination\" and that bargaining outcomes are not her responsibility.",

Watts argued the reforms restore local control and ensure financial sustainability, pointing to $900 million in savings for Auckland households under Watercare's approved plan.",

Bishop contested the figures and defended the Government's broader plan to free up land and fix infrastructure, while also highlighting the Priority One policy which has moved over 2,000 children out of emergency housing motels.",
