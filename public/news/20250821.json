Defence Minister Judith Collins confirmed the Royal New Zealand Air Force's ageing Seasprite helicopters will be replaced with five MH-60R Seahawk maritime helicopters, chosen for their combat capability and interoperability with allies like Australia and the US. Additionally, the 32-year-old Boeing 757 fleet will be replaced by two Airbus A321XLR aircraft, providing a crucial new capability to fly to Antarctica and return safely without landing if conditions are poor.",

Labour's Deputy Leader Carmel Sepuloni accused Workplace Relations Minister Brooke van Velden of forcing 180,000 workers, mostly women, to bear the cost of Budget cuts and pushing Pasifika women and wāhine Māori further backwards. Van Velden defended her position, stating she stands for women and that the system remains in place to address \"genuine cases of sex-based discrimination,\" arguing the outcomes of bargaining depend on the merits of each case.",

Labour and Green MPs argued that allowing some commercial fishing within designated \"high protection areas\" and systematically removing references to \"hapū\" and \"whānau\" from the bill undermines its core purpose. In protest, MPs proposed satirical new titles for the legislation, such as the \"'Hauraki Gulf Saying One Thing and Doing the Other Bill'\" and the \"'Hauraki Gulf / Tīkapa Moana Compromised Marine Protection Bill'.\"",

Labour's Tangi Utikere confronted Local Government Minister Simon Watts with council projections showing steep annual water bill increases for families in Christchurch ($900), Hamilton ($1,700), and Selwyn ($1,800). Minister Watts defended the 'Local Water Done Well' policy, stating it provides councils with tools for financial sustainability and rejected the premise that it limits efficiency or borrowing power, asserting Labour's previous model was a \"failed co-governed mega-entities model.\"",
