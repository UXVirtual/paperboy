        "content": "SPEAKER: Members, I've received a letter from the Hon Jan Tinetti seeking to debate, under Standing Order 399, comments by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety on appointments to the Employment Relations Authority. This is a particular case of recent occurrence for which there is ministerial responsibility. However, I do not think it reaches the level that warrants setting aside the business of the House today. The application is declined.\n: I've also received a letter from the Hon Barbara Edmonds seeking to debate, under Standing Order 399, the resignation of the chair of the Reserve Bank. This is a particular case of recent occurrence for which there is ministerial responsibility. Not all resignations are debated and it is unusual to debate the resignation of someone who is not a Minister. This matter is one that would be better explored through questions to the Minister rather than through an urgent debate. I'm not convinced that it requires the immediate attention of the House. The application is declined.\n: ORAL QUESTIONS\n: QUESTIONS TO MINISTERS\n1: . RYAN HAMILTON (National—Hamilton East) to the Minister of Finance: What recent reports has she seen on the economy?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): I saw an interesting report from Westpac recently, comparing the economic outlooks of New Zealand and Australia. A bit of healthy rivalry is a feature of the trans-Tasman relationship, so I was pleased to see Westpac—which operates on both sides of the ditch—saying that economic growth in New Zealand is set to outpace Australia, over the next few years. Westpac is forecasting annual GDP growth in New Zealand to accelerate to 2.4 percent by the end of the year, and 3.1 percent by the end of 2026. That is higher growth than the bank is forecasting for Australia. When Westpac looks at per capita—that is, per person—growth, the difference between the two countries is even greater.\nRyan Hamilton: What is supporting this growth in the New Zealand economy?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: Consistent with other forecasters, Westpac says that growth in New Zealand will be underpinned by reductions in the official cash rate (OCR) transmitting through the economy. A lower OCR leads to lower interest rates for households and businesses, who respond by spending and investing more. Westpac also points out that increases in New Zealand's commodity export prices will boost incomes and spending—thank you, farmers. It says that international demand for hard commodities—which Australia exports—is easing, while global demand for dairy and other food products—which New Zealand exports—remains firm.\nRyan Hamilton: How are interest rate reductions flowing through the economy?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: The Reserve Bank has reduced the OCR by 250 basis points over the past year, taking it down to 3 percent so far. Markets are pricing in two more reductions. Westpac makes the point that around 90 percent of mortgage lending in New Zealand is on fixed rates, compared to only around 10 to 15 percent of Australian mortgage lending. That means that interest rate changes take around 12 to 24 months to pass through the New Zealand economy. The transmission of lower interest rates is therefore still under way, with rate reductions only having begun a year ago—45 percent of mortgage lending is either floating or is due to be reprised within the next six months, which is good news for those coming on to lower interest rates.\nRyan Hamilton: What is the outlook for New Zealand exports?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: The global outlook suggests that demand for New Zealand exports will remain high despite tariffs; strength in global commodity prices—particularly dairy and meat prices—is supporting farm incomes and rural confidence. The ANZ Commodity Price Index in world prices rose again in August and is 9.3 percent higher than it was a year ago. Recent data shows that New Zealand's goods terms of trade—that is, the prices we get for our exports relative to the prices we pay for imports—is at a record high, in a series that goes all the way back to the 1950s. So New Zealand's purchasing power in the world has risen, and that is good news for our households and businesses.\nHon Chris Bishop: What reports has the Minister seen on inflation targeting?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: I have seen a report that there are spokespeople in this Parliament, open to having a discussion about changing the Reserve Bank's inflation target to allow inflation to run hotter. I'm happy to rule out—\n: SPEAKER: Probably—\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: —the Government won't be letting price increases—\n: SPEAKER: That's probably where you should leave it.\n2.: Rt Hon CHRIS HIPKINS (Leader of the Opposition) to the Acting Prime Minister: Does he stand by all his Government's statements and actions?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Acting Prime Minister): Yes, and particularly the Government introducing legislation which has led to New Zealanders up and down this country being able to vote on whether their councils should have Māori wards. Having the same basic democratic rights and duties, regardless of background, is a critical cornerstone of our democracy. And now, thanks to this Government, New Zealanders up and down the country will get to have a say about whether that is the policy in their council.\nRt Hon Chris Hipkins: Who speaks for the Government: the Prime Minister who says he wants modest, consistent house price increases, or the housing Minister who says that it's good that house prices are dropping and the Government is trying to drive house prices down?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: The facts are that the Government cannot set house prices, and I would be alarmed if any party in this House had that as their plan. What the Government is doing is introducing policies that will make it easier for New Zealanders to build more homes, and in that sense both of them are speaking for the Government because the final track of housing will depend on a range of factors. What we're doing is fixing what matters through Resource Management Act reform, Building Act reform, infrastructure funding, so that wages can grow faster than house prices, which is what we should all want for New Zealand's future.\nRt Hon Chris Hipkins: So is it the Government's goal for house prices to go up or down?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: We seem to be having a communication or comprehension problem on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition. My previous answer clearly stated that the Government's goal is to make it easier to build a home. We're doing Resource Management Act reform—wonderful work by Chris Bishop and Simon Court; we are doing Building Act reform—wonderful work by Chris Penk, the Minister for Building and Construction; and we are doing infrastructure funding and finance reform across a range of portfolios. Now, what that means is that it is easier and more affordable to build a home, and that means the next generation has ladders of opportunity to be part of a property-owning democracy, something that got further and further into the distance under the previous Government's housing inflation.\n: Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Point of order, Mr Speaker. I don't think anyone will be any the wiser as to whether or not the Government's position is that house prices should go up or down as a result of that answer.\n: SPEAKER: Well—\n: Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: I'm happy to repeat the question if the member has a comprehension problem with it.\n: SPEAKER: No, no. You can ask—\n: Hon David Seymour: Problem's all yours, buddy.\n: SPEAKER: When I'm speaking, no one else is. You can most certainly use your supplementaries to ask another question if you wish, but you can't ask me to judge the quality of the question. That's never been the case.\nRt Hon Chris Hipkins: Was Chris Bishop wrong when he said, \"The Government is trying to drive house prices down.\"?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: No, he was not, because as I have explained and will now explain for the third time—I suspect the rest of New Zealand's got it, but for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition—many of the policies that the Government is introducing are policies that will increase the supply elasticity of housing and that will, other things being equal, make it more affordable. However, it is also true that as New Zealand's economy grows under the policy of this Government, as New Zealanders become wealthier, as they bid higher prices for housing, they may well end up pushing prices up.\nRt Hon Chris Hipkins: So was Christopher Luxon wrong when he said that the Government wants, \"modest, consistent house price increases\"?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: It reminds me of when I used to tutor Econ 101. Let me explain to the Leader of the Opposition: on the one hand, we want New Zealanders to be wealthier, we want our population to grow, we want people to be bidding to raise house prices, but on the other hand, we want to make it easier to build them. Both of us want economic growth, less red tape, less regulation, and I just wish that the Leader of the Opposition would get on board.\nRt Hon Chris Hipkins: So who speaks for the Government on housing intensification: David Seymour, who says that Auckland Council's plan will bring \"significant change to the character of New Zealand's oldest suburb\", or Chris Bishop, who's called criticism of the plan \"frankly nuts\"?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: I also heard Chris Bishop say that a local MP should advocate for the interests of their constituents. And it is certainly true that the plan will change the character of the city. That is absolutely true. So, I guess, once again, despite this member's attempts to divide us, we're both right.\nRt Hon Chris Hipkins: So is the Government's position that there is therefore housing intensification and more deregulation around building more houses, except in Epsom?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: Well, that's not true at all. For example, the Epsom electorate contains the Mt Eden train station where I expect and support there will be a lot more people living to take advantage of that upgrade in infrastructure. On the other hand, there are parts of the Epsom electorate, indeed parts of Auckland and every city, which have very old infrastructure that is crumbling, in some cases leaking sewage into the sea, and it would be foolhardy to intensify in those areas. That's one reason why this Government has reversed the previous Government's policy of allowing three-storey houses on any section, including floodplains—because the previous Government did some dumb stuff, but that was among the stupidest.\nRt Hon Chris Hipkins: Is his Government committed to meeting New Zealand's emissions targets under the Paris Agreement?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: Yes, we are. But this Government, also, is a conscientious and collegial coalition of three parties who actually have a mind of their own. And on that topic, I just wonder when the Leader of the Opposition will tell the world what he thinks about someone saying that Black, Asian, and Indian New Zealanders should not participate in our democracy.\n: SPEAKER: It's—[Interruption] I'm sure most people will make the judgment that you might just have.\n: Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Point of order, Mr Speaker. How is the Acting Prime Minister reflecting on my character and making a misrepresentation about something that I have or haven't said in any way relevant to the question or acceptable within the House?\n: SPEAKER: Well, now that you raise it, that's not acceptable, but it is in the nature of debate. I don't think it would be fair to require it to be withdrawn or other such in the circumstances, because if you think about the nature of the questioning, it was along those lines—\n: Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Point of order, Mr Speaker.\n: SPEAKER: No, hang on a minute, I'm still speaking. You were, in your question, questioning the integrity and veracity of statements made by the Hon David Seymour compared to anybody else. It's not unreasonable that there is a comparison put back. Speakers' Rulings has a number of comments in it: if a political question is asked, expect a political answer. I think that's not unreasonable.\n: Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Point of order, Mr Speaker. What in particular did you find political about a question that said, \"Is his Government committed to meeting New Zealand's emissions targets under the Paris Agreement?\"—because that was the question.\n: SPEAKER: No, that is quite right. The point I'm making is that, in the nature of the whole exchange, there was a high degree of political contention. Look, Speaker's ruling 187/1.\n: Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Further point of order, Mr Speaker. No matter how political a debate, a member is not entitled to misrepresent the words of another member.\n: SPEAKER: Well, from my memory, what he said is he invited a comment or a reflection on those, which he shouldn't have done. But it might help if the Acting Prime Minister, or the Prime Minister in this case, withdrew the comment.\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: Point of order, Mr Speaker. My answer simply held up a mirror to the Leader of the Opposition's questions. If he doesn't like what he sees, then perhaps he should change the questions.\n: SPEAKER: No, no; that's your opinion.\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: For the sake of this country being able to get on with question time, I withdraw the comment.\nSPEAKER: Thank you.\n3.: Dr PARMJEET PARMAR (ACT) to the Acting Prime Minister: Does he stand by all of the Government's statements and actions?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Acting Prime Minister): Yes, absolutely and enthusiastically, particularly those actions that this Government is taking to cut wasteful spending, to cut red tape, and to enable New Zealanders to build their lives, their families, their firms, and their farms in this country so that we can all live a more prosperous life and overcome those challenges that we face.\nDr Parmjeet Parmar: What changes are being made to resource management law?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: This country is a beautiful place and, in my view, the best in the world to live, but we have made it too hard for too long to build a place to live. That's why this Government is replacing the resource management laws with laws that don't say a council and anyone else that they ask has the right to say no all the time, that says that New Zealanders have the right to develop their property as they please, so long as they don't harm the enjoyment of others' property. That is a wonderful principle, it is a step-change in land use development, and it will allow the next generation to be able to build their futures, just as their grandparents were able to do, and give each of us, of any background, a brighter future in New Zealand.\nDr Parmjeet Parmar: How will the Government's changes to our health and safety laws help small businesses?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: This country was built on a number eight wire, can-do, Sir Edmund Hillary, Kiwi attitude, and yet too often we find ourselves fearful of the very Government that we pay to enforce the laws. That's why I'm very proud to have this Government amending the approach to health and safety away from having lots of fear and not enough safety—retooling WorkSafe in such a way that it is there to guide and help people actually achieve safety as much as it is there to punish people. Brooke van Velden is to be commended for going out and listening and making substantial changes that make people's lives better.\nDr Parmjeet Parmar: How is the Government making it easier for overseas investors to invest in New Zealand businesses and help them grow?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: This country has a long history of welcoming our friends around the world to share their money and their ideas, investing together in New Zealand's future. However, for too long we made it too hard for those people to come and join in New Zealand's economic success. It's not because they didn't want to; it's because we tied them up in too much bureaucracy and red tape. I'm proud that we have halved the time for overseas investment consents under this Government, and I'm proud that legislative changes before the House at the moment will see even greater improvements in the time taken for people to get consent to bring their money and their ideas in.\nDr Parmjeet Parmar: Why is the Government simplifying our anti - money-laundering legislation?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: This is another example where in the rush to satisfy obligations imposed by overseas powers, we have hamstrung New Zealanders with red tape on things as simple as trying to open a bank account for a child. This Government is simplifying anti - money-laundering laws so that people can spend more time doing things that are productive, providing for themselves and their families, and less time tied up in red tape.\nDr Parmjeet Parmar: How is the Government's Regulatory Standards Bill going to help raise the standard of lawmaking in New Zealand?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: For a long time, Governments have made various attempts at improving the quality of regulation and ensuring that there is a voice for the regulated, that people's property is respected, and that laws are made for the public interest rather than for short-term political advantage by certain politicians. The Regulatory Standards Bill will ensure that people's rights are set out clearly in law so that the public are better able to judge the quality of the laws being made, and that is a welcome maturation in our constitutional settings in New Zealand.\n4: . DAN BIDOIS (National—Northcote) to the Minister of Transport: What announcements has he made regarding Auckland transport governance?\nHon CHRIS BISHOP (Minister of Transport): Last week, the Government announced—the Minister of Auckland, Hon Simeon Brown, and His Worship Wayne Brown—we'll be delivering on our promise to restore local democracy to Auckland. Responsibility for most transport functions in Auckland will shift from Auckland Transport to Auckland Council, including all policy and planning work. The council will become the road controlling authority and deliver transport capital projects while maintaining transport infrastructure. This is the case in every other council around the country, apart from in Auckland, and we are now bringing Auckland into line with every other council.\nDan Bidois: How does this change restore local democracy in Auckland?\nHon CHRIS BISHOP: Local democracy in Auckland is very important. Right now, Aucklanders raise their transport concerns with local councillors, local board members, or even the mayor. That's instinctively who New Zealanders think are responsible for their local roads, but the levers Auckland Council has to effect change are very little. Auckland Council does not have direct control over its transport system currently, nor is it a road controlling authority. We are making Auckland Council directly responsible for local roads again so that when Aucklanders raise concerns with their elected local representatives, they actually have levers to do something about it.\nDan: Bidois: What about future planning for Auckland's transport system?\nHon CHRIS BISHOP: The changes will establish an Auckland regional transport committee, comprising an equal share of Auckland Council members and ministerial appointees alongside an independent chair. It will prepare a 30-year transport plan for Auckland, building on the previous Auckland Transport alignment project from the last National Government, to steer investment and shape the future of transport in Auckland. It's critical to get central and local government aligned, and I'm really confident this plan will do just that.\nDan: Bidois: What reaction has he seen to this announcement?\nHon CHRIS BISHOP: There has been widespread support from many Aucklanders. I quote proud Aucklander Simeon Brown: \"For too long, Auckland Transport has not listened to Aucklanders.\" I want to thank Mayor Brown and Simeon Brown for their hard work on these campaigns. Aucklanders don't have to wait too long for these changes to be made. The bill will have its first reading this month and it's meant to pass into law next year, so we can get on with restoring local democracy to Auckland.\n5.: Hon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana) to the Minister of Finance: Does she stand by all her statements and actions in relation to the resignations of the former Reserve Bank Chair and Governor?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Mr Speaker, yes.\nHon Barbara Edmonds: When did she first become aware of the reasons for Adrian Orr's resignation?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: That was on the Thursday night when I read the Ombudsman's ruling—which, as I check my timing, was 27 August—which outlined the specific concerns which were in the letter of concerns shared by the Reserve Bank, a letter I have not seen and had not seen previously, and which also detailed events preceding the receipt of that letter.\nHon Barbara Edmonds: Was she aware that a letter of concern had been sent before 28 August?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: On 27 February, I received a text message from the Secretary to the Treasury informing me that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand board had agreed to start an employment process in respect of the governor of the Reserve Bank. Later that night, in a separate text message, I was informed that the governor had elected to go on leave until the end of the process, and that he had been given until the close of business Monday to respond to a board statement of concern on his conduct.\nHon Barbara Edmonds: Why was the contents of that text on 27 February withheld under the Official Information Act (OIA)?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: I have asked that very question today of my own team, who, through Treasury, I think have upheld high standards over the OIA throughout this exchange. They inform me that it was withheld under section 9(ba)(i), which is to protect information which is subject to an obligation of confidence likely to prejudice the supply of information of that sort in future. I have judged that it is in the public interest for me to share the contents of that text message with Parliament today.\nHon Barbara Edmonds: Is she aware that the contents of that text was withheld in an earlier OIA request, and why is it that just today she is releasing to the public the contents of that text, given her responsibility under the Reserve Bank Act?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: Well, because I am satisfied that the grounds for withholding under the Official Information Act were valid. I also think that it is now correct, given the official information that has been released by the Reserve Bank, that I provide this information to Parliament.\n: SPEAKER: I just suggest that this is not a matter for some of the cross-House banter that's going on while answers are being given.\nRt Hon Winston Peters: Can I ask the Minister, has she heard the song, \"Who wants yesterday's paper? Who wants yesterday's news?\" and is she getting on with the future management of the Reserve Bank?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: A very good question, indeed, and I look forward to welcoming a new Governor of the Reserve Bank very soon.\nHon Barbara Edmonds: Was her office or herself consulted on in relation to the OIA, under which the text of 27 February was withheld?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: I would have to check to give you the most accurate answer, but it is normal that, when Treasury, receives an Official Information Act request, my office is informed about their intended response to it. I think, in this case, Treasury was making a judgment based on two things: one, the fact that the text specifically referred to an employment process that had been commenced that, at that point, had not been released by the employer in question, and so therefore sharing that information when the employer subject to the exit agreement had chosen not to share it would have actually triggered the concern in the Official Information Act—[Interruption] It is very hard to even hear myself think with all of that barracking, Mr Speaker. It is, therefore, in terms of the Official Information Act, correct that it could have prejudiced the receipt of that sort of information in future, as I've said in this House clearly. It is my view now, in light of the timeline of events that the Ombudsman has released, which makes clear that that letter of concern had been released, that it is in the public interest for me to share that I was informed of that employment process having begun on 27 February.\nHon Barbara Edmonds: Is she confirming that neither she nor her office was consulted in relation to the information and contents of a text that was withheld under the Official Information Act (OIA)?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: I'm confirming no such thing.\nHon Barbara Edmonds: Is she confident that her handling of information requests relating to the exit of the former governor did meet her expectations of transparency and of public accountability?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: Yes.\nHon Barbara Edmonds: Why should New Zealanders have confidence in her when she has only just advised the House and the public of the contents of a text on 27 February, and how is it not usual that either she or her office have not reviewed the OIA before it was released?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: Because these are matters relating to an employment process. If Minister's choose to engage themselves in employment processes characterising them when they have not been a party to those processes, they risk politicising those processes in ways that can threaten the reputation of important institutions.\nRt Hon Winston Peters: Regardless of this boring dialogue, how will the new Reserve Bank Governor go if there is no inflation cap set for the governor?\n: Hon Kieran McAnulty: Just for absolute clarity in the House, it's now OK to provide that sort of commentary before asking a question?\n: SPEAKER: It's an observation, and it is not something that should be done. Questions should be simple, start with a question word, and carry on, and I've made that point before.\n: Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: They also have to relate to the primary.\n: SPEAKER: Well, if you look at the primary, it talks in relation to—\n: Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: The resignation.\n: SPEAKER: —statements and actions in relation to the resignation of the former—but, look, as we know, questions move on. [Interruption] Wait on, wait on. I think, in this case, we will simply move on. The point has been made.\n6.: CHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green) to the Minister of Finance: Does she stand by all the Government's statements and actions on economic and fiscal policy?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Yes, and I particularly stand by our commitment to an inflation target of 1 to 3 percent with a midpoint of 2. Unlike some members of this House, I won't be advocating for faster price increases across the economy, which would only add to the cost of living.\nChlöe Swarbrick: Does she stand by her statement that \"investing in smart, targeted … interventions … not only make a difference in the lives of … whānau, but mean the Government reduces the money it might otherwise [spend] on treating the symptoms rather than the cause of dysfunction\", and, if she does, does she consider ensuring that our most vulnerable New Zealanders have somewhere safe to sleep at night a \"smart, targeted early intervention\"?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: In answer to the first part of the question: yes.\nChlöe Swarbrick: What does she consider to be \"treating the symptoms rather than the cause of dysfunction\" if not her Government's decision to cancel thousands of new public homes and now pump taxpayer money into the private rental market for just 300 temporary homes?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: Well, a very good example of treating the symptoms and not the cause of a problem would be the Government continuing to provide ever-larger subsidies for State-sponsored housing while failing to deal with the underlying driver of ridiculous house price increases in New Zealand, which is planning law that has been weaponised against progress and development, weaponised against new housing subdivisions, weaponised against housing intensification. This Government is getting to the root cause of New Zealand's housing unaffordability problems by getting rid of the Resource Management Act (RMA) and saying yes to more houses.\nChlöe Swarbrick: Does she accept that investment in public housing reduces crime; saves money in health; and improves educational, employment, and broader economic outcomes, and, if so, why has the Government decided to cancel building thousands of new State homes and slash emergency housing access, generating greater homelessness across the country?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: Well, yes, I agree that publicly funded housing can deliver a range of positive social outcomes. But it's also the case that we need to ensure that public housing is delivered efficiently, that it is the right kind of houses that are of the right typographies created in a value-for-money way. It's also the case that under the last Government, the number of people on the State house waiting list multiplied even while they said that they were dealing with State housing challenges.\nRt Hon Winston Peters: Could I ask the Minister on this question of the house rental costs: has it gone up in the last 12 months or has it come down?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: Well, I understand that, in fact, rent increases are the lowest they've been in some years. In fact, according to a measure I read yesterday, rents have actually declined, which I would have thought the member for Auckland Central—who used to claim she stood for renters—would be welcoming and even celebrating.\nChlöe Swarbrick: What is the economic cost of the increased homelessness that has resulted from Government decisions which it was warned would happen if it went ahead with those very decisions?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: Well, there are a lot of assertions in that question, but what is absolutely the case—and which the numbers prove—is that while that member was a supporting member of this Parliament of the previous Government, it is the case that thousands of children were being raised in motel rooms that I can guarantee didn't meet your healthy homes standards. You stood by, you tolerated it. We've fixed it. [Interruption]\n: Hon Chris Bishop: Supplementary question.\n: SPEAKER: Hold on. We're going to wait while everybody calms down.\nHon Chris Bishop: Can the Minister confirm that 50 percent of people on the social housing register need a one-bedroom unit but Kāinga Ora only has 12 percent of its stock being one bedroom, and of the 1,500 houses funded in Budget 2024 that have been allocated so far, 89 percent of those houses are for one- and two-bedroom units?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: Yes. What this underscores is the importance of ensuring we don't just build houses, but that we build the right houses that respond to the needs we see in our community. I'm also happy to confirm that the creation of the community housing fund means that this Government has deliberately decreased the cost of borrowing for those community organisations wishing to build more public housing.\nChlöe Swarbrick: Will the finance Minister then take up the invitation—which the Prime Minister has so far ignored—to walk the streets of Auckland Central to meet the people, including the children, who her Government's decisions have made homeless?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: Well, I think the more immediate response, if the member is aware of any children living on the street, would be for her to urgently bring that information to the Ministry of Social Development to ensure those children get the support to which they are entitled.\nRt Hon Winston Peters: If the Prime Minister does take up the invitation, could she possibly warn the Prime Minister that if he does, he'll have to face all those orange cones that the Green Party and others have put on the main street of central Auckland—in her electorate?\n: SPEAKER: No, that's not a question for the Minister of Finance.\n7.: Dr VANESSA WEENINK (National—Banks Peninsula) to the Minister of Health: What recent announcements has he made about improved access to elective procedures for patients?\nHon SIMEON BROWN (Minister of Health): Good news: the Government has exceeded its first Elective Boost target, delivering 16,005 additional procedures by 30 June—that is 50.3 percent more than planned, meaning thousands more New Zealanders have received life-changing surgery, such as hip and knee replacements and cataract operations, sooner. Our initiative has reduced pressure on wait-lists and, most importantly, helped Kiwis get the care they need when they need it.\nDr Vanessa Weenink: What impact has the Elective Boost had on wait-lists?\nHon SIMEON BROWN: Well, since the boost began, the total elective treatment wait-list has dropped by 9 percent, and the number of people waiting more than four months has fallen by 22 percent. These improvements have been felt across the country, with 4,766 procedures being carried out in the Northern region, 5,051 in the Midland, 2,961 in Central, and 3,227 procedures in the South Island. We acknowledge that too many New Zealanders have been waiting too long for the care that they need, and that's why we're continuing to put patients first and deliver for them.\nDr Vanessa Weenink: Who has benefited from the Elective Boost so far?\nHon SIMEON BROWN: Kiwis from all walks of life have benefited from our Elective Boost. We've seen 638 hip surgeries, 751 knee surgeries, and 5,058 cataract surgeries carried out. Behind each one of those numbers is a New Zealander whose quality of life has been improved—whether it's a tradie who can get back to work, a nana being able to see her grandchildren clearly again, or a child finally getting their tonsils removed. This Government is focused on patients and delivering the outcomes that New Zealanders expect.\nDr Vanessa Weenink: What is the next step in the Government's plan to improve access to elective procedures?\nHon SIMEON BROWN: Well, this is just the beginning, and the next phase is already under way, with the target of an additional 21,000 elective procedures over the coming year. We're making the health system work smarter, using both public hospitals and private providers in a coordinated national effort. New Zealanders don't care who is delivering the service; they just want it done, and they want it done quickly. That is the approach this Government is taking, and it's delivering results.\n8.: Hon Dr AYESHA VERRALL (Labour) to the Minister of Health: Does he stand by his statement, \"we want to get value for money for the taxpayer\" for surgeries outsourced to private hospitals; if so, how is Health New Zealand achieving value for money?\nHon SIMEON BROWN (Minister of Health): To the first part of that question, in the context it was made, yes. As I've said before, working with private providers means we can deliver more hip operations, knee replacements, and cataract surgeries, helping to reduce wait-lists. I'm advised that Health New Zealand operated a competitive request for proposal (RFP) process across the private hospitals for planned care treatment in 2024. It is now preparing to renew the panel agreements from 2026 with nationally standardised terms and conditions while maintaining a competitive market. This process has given Health New Zealand insights and prices from all providers for a wide range of procedures. Health New Zealand used this information and its own internal costings to negotiate the optimal price for each location and each treatment. As a result of the boost, the total wait-list has fallen by 9 percent and the number of people waiting more than four months has dropped by 22 percent—a great result for patients.\nHon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Will he release the price Health New Zealand pays for outsourcing surgeries to private providers?\nHon SIMEON BROWN: Well, as I announced back in March, Health New Zealand had allocated approximately $50 million as part of the elective boost to deliver an extra 10,500 procedures by the middle of the year, and, of course, they delivered more than that, which is great news for patients.\n: Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Point of order, Mr Speaker. The question was about the price paid for the procedures, not the cost to Health New Zealand. The price wasn't even addressed.\n: SPEAKER: Well, I think it was, when he said that the allocation was $50 million and they got more for it than they did.\n: Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Speaking to the point of order, that is the amount Health New Zealand spends, but the price—for example, that a hip operation cost $20,000—wasn't addressed at all.\n: SPEAKER: OK, I'm sitting here thinking, \"Should I ask the Minister to say more?\", but, I'm sorry, in my head, when I heard $50 million was spent and they got more for it than they expected, they're probably in the right space, but if the Minister wants to make a comment, that's his prerogative.\nHon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Why, when ACC releases the price per procedure that they pay for surgeries, won't Health New Zealand release that information for private surgeries?\nHon SIMEON BROWN: Well, as I said in my primary answer, they have gone through a competitive RFP process to ensure that they can negotiate the prices. I'm advised that Health New Zealand at this time is going through further procurement processes with nationally consistent terms, and it is important that they are able to maintain a competitive market. Ultimately, we've allocated funds, and our focus is on making sure that we deliver outcomes for patients and get those treatments done sooner. It's exactly what the previous Minister of Health, the Rt Hon Chris Hipkins, said in a Cabinet paper in 2020, where he said, \"I expect DHBs and their local private hospital(s) to reach appropriate contractual arrangements that allow for services to be increased to address backlogs.\" That's exactly what we're doing.\nHon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Why, when the Government is, in his own words, paying significant premiums for outsourced surgeries, won't he release the price of those surgeries?\nHon SIMEON BROWN: Well, Health New Zealand is working through a contractual process to ensure value for money. That is the right thing for them to do. Ultimately, this is about delivering additional services—\n: Hon Damien O'Connor: Money for your mates.\nHon SIMEON: BROWN: —for New Zealanders so they spend less time waiting on wait-lists. We've been very clear that $50 million was allocated; more surgeries were delivered. The final cost of the elective boost in the first half of this year will—ultimately, the costings of that will be confirmed as part of the end-of-year financial accounts. The fact that over 50 percent more surgeries were delivered means that the cost was probably likely to be higher than the $50 million allocated, but, ultimately, this is about patients getting the services they need in a more timely manner.\n: Hon David Seymour: Point of order. During that answer, a Labour member said, \"Money for your mates.\" in reference to the Government's procurement process. That member happens to be a real stickler for the rules; I wonder if he'd like to withdraw it.\n: SPEAKER: Well, whoever said it needs to just rein themselves in a bit. That is not an acceptable thing.\n: Hon Damien O'Connor: Point of order, Mr Speaker. Thank you, Mr Speaker. I said that, but I'm not a sticker for the rules, so I'm not quite sure who the member was referring to.\n: SPEAKER: Yep, well, only a West Coaster could come up with that, so you get a bit of leeway.\n9.: RIMA NAKHLE (National—Takanini) to the Minister for Trade and Investment: What recent progress has the Government made in unlocking new opportunities for New Zealand exporters in the United Arab Emirates?\nHon TODD: McCLAY (Minister for Trade and Investment): On 28 August, the New Zealand - United Arab Emirates Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement officially entered into force, just seven months after signature. It's New Zealand's fastest ever negotiated agreement—negotiated in just on four months—and is one of New Zealand's highest-quality agreements on entry into force. It's part of the Government's plan to back Kiwi exporters, create more jobs, and to increase wages.\nRima Nakhle: What specific market access improvements does the United Arab Emirates deal deliver for New Zealand exporters, especially for the primary sector?\nHon TODD: McCLAY: Well, the UAE is a key hub in the Gulf region, with two-way trade valued at just under $1.5 billion annually; and 98.5 percent of New Zealand's exports to the UAE will now enter duty free, rising to 99 percent within three years. Key goods including dairy, red meat, apples, kiwifruit, seafood, forestry products, and honey—they're all duty free now. The agreement also includes significant commitments to support New Zealand's professional services, including the education, gaming, film, and engineering industries.\nRima Nakhle: How will the United Arab Emirates deal improve New Zealand's global competitiveness?\nHon TODD: McCLAY: Well, New Zealand's a trading nation and we don't get rich only selling to ourselves, so the agreement positions New Zealand to compete with the best in the world. It secures preferential access for New Zealand exporters across competitive sectors vital to our economy and in areas that our exporters have had to compete against others in the UAE. It also strengthens supply chains with a vital trading partner and introduces provisions on sustainable development, intellectual property, and labour that reflect New Zealand's high standards. This is a trade deal that delivers for hard-working New Zealanders and means our exporters can do better in a market that will return more money to the pockets of Kiwis.\nRima Nakhle: How does this United Arab Emirates deal align with the Government's trade and investment strategy?\nHon TODD: McCLAY: Well, the UAE trade deal's an important step in our strategy to reduce trade barriers and offer new opportunities to New Zealand exporters. The deal unlocks a US$500 billion economy that's growing and diversifying rapidly. The UAE imports 90 percent of its food, creating strong new opportunities for New Zealand's world-class food producers and, of course, therefore our farmers. With this agreement and the conclusion of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) deal last October, the Government is focused on growing the economy; unlocking key markets; increasing export returns; and, again, creating higher-paying jobs for New Zealanders.\n10.: DEBBIE NGAREWA-PACKER (Co-Leader—Te Pāti Māori) to the Acting Prime Minister: Does he stand by all his Government's statements and actions?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (: Acting Prime Minister): Yes, absolutely. I'd particularly like to reference this Government's reintroduction of charter schools, kura hourua: in the Far North, Te Rito; in South Auckland, TIPENE; and now in Kaikohe, potentially, Northland College—schools where communities are adopting the charter school, kura hourua model. They are enabling students from all background, but in many cases Māori students, to be empowered to navigate the 21st century with the skills and education that all of us require to do that. I note that, in the past, the member's party has been a staunch supporter of the charter school concept, and I hope that she will reaffirm it.\nDebbie Ngarewa-Packer: Will the Prime Minister call for the safe passage of the Global Sumud Flotilla, a fleet of boats carrying delegations from all around the world, including New Zealanders, delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: We are focused on the wellbeing of people in New Zealand primarily. There is a huge amount of suffering, of people right here in this country, that we are focused on alleviating. I find it strange that a party is so focused on a symbolic statement that it would like to see the Government make. I would have thought their priorities would be a little closer to home.\n: Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Point of order. New Zealand has a UN membership duty to protect its own citizens abroad. That squarely sits within this Government's responsibility. That question should be asked and answered squarely for all New Zealanders who want to know what you're doing to protect New Zealanders that are on the flotilla.\n: SPEAKER: Well, that might be the response that the member wants, but the question was answered when the Acting Prime Minister said that primarily the focus is on people suffering in this country.\n: Rt Hon Winston Peters: Point of order. With respect, the question is bordering on the requisite to rule it out, because we have put out official statements, in the interests of New Zealanders' safety, against entry to Gaza, the possible human damage that will result from it, and on joining flotillas, for the same purpose. This Government has put out numerous statements for people not to do that, and you've got somebody here today in question time demanding that we do just that.\n: SPEAKER: Well, the question was, with all due respect, about what is being done, and perhaps that was an answer the Acting Prime Minister might have given, but I think the intervention is most useful in that regard. Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, please contain your question—just ask your question.\nDebbie Ngarewa-Packer: Does he accept that failing to demand safe humanitarian corridors puts New Zealanders delivering aid at risk?\n: SPEAKER: Sorry, can I hear that question again?\nDebbie Ngarewa-Packer: Does he accept that failing to demand safe humanitarian corridors puts New Zealanders delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza at risk?\n: SPEAKER: Look, I don't know that the Prime Minister could have responsibility for that. With all due respect, there is no answer available for that.\nDebbie Ngarewa-Packer: Does the Prime Minister believe that the Government has an obligation to protect New Zealand citizens abroad?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: Yes, the New Zealand Government does its best to protect New Zealand citizens abroad, but often the way that the New Zealand Government does that is by warning them not to go to dangerous places, and the reason for that is that the New Zealand Government does not have the power to influence the safety of every person on the planet, agile and effective though the New Zealand Defence Force may be. But there is something in this line of questioning where the member really believes that the New Zealand Government making a demand will make people on the other side of the world safe. Now, when we live in a country where a child is killed, on average, every five weeks, I would have thought it would be time to return to the real and the practical, rather than the symbolic and the theatrical.\nDebbie Ngarewa-Packer: Does he accept the findings of the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and the International Criminal Court that the famine in Gaza City affecting over 500,000 people is man-made?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: Well, those organisations might very well make those claims, but the fact is that the New Zealand Government takes practical actions where it believes it can have an effect. That includes devoting, if my memory serves me, $37 million of taxpayer money in aid to that part of the world. That includes sanctioning two Israeli Ministers that we believe have said things that they certainly should not have said. That includes criticising and calling for the immediate release of all hostages by Hamas. If the member believes the most important thing we can do is talk about whether an organisation's statement is correct or not, I don't think she is living in the real world.\nDebbie Ngarewa-Packer: Has the Government sought assurances from Israel that humanitarian workers will be protected?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: This is an area which is at war, and we do well to remember that it is at war because a terrorist group invaded a peaceful country, kidnapped, raped, and kept hostages and continues to use those hostages as bargaining chips. I would have thought a bit of awareness would leave the member well ahead of where she is right now in her understanding.\n: Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Point of order. [Interruption]\n: SPEAKER: Points of order are heard in silence.\n: Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: My question is not about Hamas. It is about New Zealanders delivering humanitarian aid and the community accepting that the famine is man-made. My supplementary, please, for the Speaker.\n: SPEAKER: Yes, and the question was most—\n: Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Is the Prime Minister—\n: SPEAKER: Sorry, sorry—where are you at? You just took a point of order, and you hadn't asked me to respond to it.\n: Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Sorry, if you want to, that's great. Apologies.\n: SPEAKER: The question was addressed. Ask another supplementary.\nDebbie Ngarewa-Packer: Is the Prime Minister stating that they dispute the findings of the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)?\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR: What I'm saying is that the Government does not have responsibility for—as the member said just a second ago—what the community thinks. Now, there are some societies where the Government does take responsibility for what the community thinks, but I don't want to live in one of those societies.\n11: . Hon GINNY ANDERSEN (Labour) to the Minister for Economic Growth: Does she agree with the statement of the Minister of Finance that \"cost of living relief is on its way\"; if so, why?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister for Economic Growth): Yes. As Minister of Finance, I made that statement last year when announcing tax relief that benefitted millions of New Zealand households. Changes to income tax thresholds, the in-work tax credit, and other measures made around 1.9 million New Zealand households better off, on average, by $60 a fortnight. Households with children were even better off, on average, by $78 a fortnight. All superannuitants were better off, and members opposite voted against it.\nHon Ginny Andersen: Why is administrative inflation the highest it's been since 1990?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: The largest driver of that is rates increases, which is why, on this side of the House, we have the courage to investigate caps on rates rises, which her leader seems to think would be a terrible thing.\nHon Ginny Andersen: Why should families carry the burden of higher costs, such as public transport and vehicle registrations, when those pressures stem directly from her Government's decision to cut spending and raise fees?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: I am very concerned by price increases in the economy, which is why, under this Government, we're targeting inflation between 1 to 3 percent with a mid-band of 2 percent. I understand that the approach of that member and her party is to advocate for higher price increases across the economy with an inflation mid-point of 2.5 percent, which would mean higher prices for everything.\nHon Ginny Andersen: Is the reason that 60 percent of New Zealanders still rank the cost as living as their number one concern due to her Government continually hiking up fees that Kiwis are forced to pay?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: No.\nHon Ginny Andersen: Is the reason that Kiwis are losing faith with National's ability to manage the economy due to her empty promises that relief is on its way, while she continues to hike fees that just make the cost of living even worse?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS: No, if we're going to talk about empty promises, let's talk about crocodile tears. If that member really cared about the cost of living and providing income relief to New Zealand households, she would have voted for tax relief, and she would vote for the increases in the FamilyBoost rebate that this party will soon bring to the House.\n12.: Hon MARAMA DAVIDSON (Co-Leader—Green) to the Minister of Foreign Affairs: Does he stand by all of the Government's statements and actions on foreign policy?\nRt Hon WINSTON PETERS (Minister of Foreign Affairs): Yes, as articulated and undertaken by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, as written by his staff this afternoon, and endorsed by all of Foreign Affairs here and in the many far-flung posts abroad.\nHon Marama Davidson: Does he stand by his statement of 29 days ago that \"The Government will carefully weigh up its position over the next month on recognition of a state of Palestine.\", and, if so, what decision, if any, has the Government come to?\nRt Hon WINSTON PETERS: To the first part of that question, of course I stand by that decision, and to the second part, when the decision is made, I'll tell that member what it is.\nHon Marama Davidson: Why is his Government still making up its mind on recognising statehood while France, Canada, the UK, Australia, Norway, and Spain have all opted to do so?\nRt Hon WINSTON PETERS: Well, with the greatest of respect, if you want to look at democracies, which one of those countries can tell us what a democracy should look like, given our proud record going all the way back to 1854, and giving Māori the vote in 1867 and women the vote first, before all the other countries.\n: Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Oh, lucky Māoris! You \"gave\" us—you \"gave\" us.\nRt Hon WINSTON: PETERS: No, no, no, no—not half-Māori; I mean real ones. Not the Irish Packers—not Irish Packers.\n: Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Point of order, Mr Speaker.\n: SPEAKER: Point of order, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer—to be heard in silence.\n: Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: I take offence to what the previous speaker has just said. It is not appropriate to use this place to blood-quantum, and to sit there and suggest that someone—\n: Hon Members: Oh!\n: Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: —is part something.\n: SPEAKER: Just a moment. Now, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer is going to repeat her point of order, and there will be no response along those lines. Anyone who does will of course be leaving the House.\n: Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Mr Speaker, thank you. I take exception to the language that was used by the previous speaker suggesting blood quantum and that Māori should be considered \"part\". That is unparliamentary language.\n: SPEAKER: Well, it certainly is, and I'd invite the member to withdraw that comment and continue his—\nRt Hon WINSTON: PETERS: No, no. Point of order, Mr Speaker. When I got to the point about the quality of New Zealand's democracy, first in 1854 and then Māori getting the vote in 1867, that's when they started shouting about blood quantum and everything else. It's they that made the offence, sir, and I was reacting to it. They just can't take the heat.\n: SPEAKER: I must confess that there was an awful lot of noise. I didn't hear the full exchange. I will look at the Hansard and come back to the House.\n: Hon Kieran McAnulty: Point of order, Mr Speaker.\n: SPEAKER: Sorry?\n: Hon Kieran McAnulty: Point of order, sir.\n: SPEAKER: Look, I've just told you that I'm coming back to the House when I've looked at the Hansard, so there's no other bits to it.\n: Hon Kieran McAnulty: Well, I'm not disputing that, sir—\n: SPEAKER: Good.\n: Hon Kieran McAnulty: —but you've asked a member to withdraw, and he did not.\n: SPEAKER: That's right, and I've said that I would now look at the Hansard because I never heard the comment and the member has disputed that it was objectionable.\n: Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Point of order, Mr Speaker. You can check the Hansard, but I can guarantee that I did not say that, and it was me that placed the point of order.\n: SPEAKER: Well, that is trifling with the Chair, which is not an advisable thing.\nHon Marama Davidson: Is he comfortable with allowing New Zealand to become part of just 20 percent of nations who still have no commitment to recognising Palestinian statehood?\nRt Hon WINSTON PETERS: The reality is that the circumstances are dramatically changing. We're going off to the United Nations, and, hopefully, by then we will know all the facts. If this was a financial decision, that's the least we would do, and this is a critical decision, as well. We've said from the very beginning that it's not a question of \"if\"; it's \"when\", but it's the quality of the recognition, or the standards we have set, that we do not seek to let ourselves down on. This is not against anyone at all, and might I just say this: we have spent considerable time talking to scores and scores of countries in the Middle East and elsewhere who understand our position and respect it. Who has she talked to?\nHon Marama Davidson: Is he concerned that every day the international community delays recognition of Palestinian statehood, a two-State solution becomes further out of reach, as Israel continues building illegal settlements without consequence?\n: Hon Shane Jones: Speculation.\nRt Hon WINSTON PETERS: This is the kind of illogical thinking that should be—\n: Chlöe Swarbrick: We voted on the motion, Shane, in September.\n: SPEAKER: No, no, hang on—sorry. Don't ask a question—\nRt Hon WINSTON: PETERS: But I can handle it—don't worry.\n: SPEAKER: I'm not talking to you. I'm just saying to these people over here on the other side of the House: don't ask a question of that nature, which is barely permissible under the Standing Orders, and then start barracking over the top of it when an answer starts.\nRt Hon WINSTON: PETERS: This the kind of illogical thinking that we'd hope would be expunged from somebody before they even got to Parliament. To come here and make that statement when there's not a shred of evidence to back it up is, I think, a disappointment for this Parliament and, dare I say, for the Green Party.\nHon Marama Davidson: Does he agree with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade that \"As a small country which depends on the international rules-based system for both security and prosperity, it is fundamental to New Zealand interests that these rules are supported and that serious violations are sanctioned.\", and, if so, why has the Government not sanctioned Israel for their serious violations of international law in Palestine?\nRt Hon WINSTON PETERS: For the umpteenth time, we have condemned on countless occasions more than any other circumstance we've been involved in in recent politics what has gone on there, and we have sanctioned Israelis, and we have sanctioned members of Parliament, as well. This has all been stated to this country. What would we do now? This idea that, somehow, whatever New Zealand does is going to stop the strife and solve the situation is, I think, extraordinarily naïve. But here's the point: we're going to the United Nations, and we'll have the benefit of every country's view at that point in time, and then we can make a seriously considered decision then.\n: SPEAKER: That concludes oral questions.\nHon KIERAN: McANULTY (Labour): Point of order, Mr Speaker. Thank you very much, sir. On two occasions today during question time, you asked a Minister to withdraw a statement. On the first occasion, there was commentary provided by the Minister before the withdrawal was made, and on the second occasion there was no withdrawal made. Now, a former member for the seat of Ilam, when shadow Leader of the House, if asked to withdraw and apologise would do so and then make a point of order, which is the proper process, and given your commitment to review what has occurred during the last question, I wonder whether you would also agree to review whether the request to withdraw comments today was followed as it should be. My concern is if that is the approach that is allowed moving forward, it is yet another step towards disorder in the House.\nSPEAKER: Well, I thank you for pointing out the considerable wisdom of the former member for the Ilam seat. Certainly, a volume of information from that member is going to be considered in any decisions I make, and I'll come back to the member tomorrow with an answer on that.\n: I declare the House in committee for consideration of the Appropriation (2025/26 Estimates) Bill.",

        "topic": "In Committee",
        "content": "CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Members, the House is in committee for consideration of the Appropriation (2025/26 Estimates) Bill. The Business Committee has determined to organise the debate by portfolio, so there will be no sector-specific debates. All Votes are available for debate, but only specific Ministers will be available each day to speak to the indicated portfolio. The Government has indicated that the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, the Minister of Transport, the Minister of Housing, the Minister for the Environment, and the Minister for Vocational Education will be available today.\n: Each debate will be led by a call from the chairperson or member of the committee that considers the Estimates most closely related to the Minister's portfolio. In leading off the debate, the chairperson should take care not to be overly political and should ensure their call gives a fair reflection of the committee's report on the Votes relevant to the portfolio. The debate expires after 11 hours, at which point questions will be put that the Vote stand part of the Schedules and on the provisions of the Appropriation (2025/26 Estimates) Bill.\n: New Zealand National has four hours and 25 minutes. New Zealand Labour has three hours and four minutes. The Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand has one hour and 21 minutes. ACT New Zealand has 60 minutes. New Zealand First has 43 minutes. Te Pati Māori has 27 minutes. The Estimates debate should be relevant to the Government's current spending plans as contained in the Estimates of Appropriations. A compendium of the reports of select committees on the Votes is available on the Table. The question is that the Votes contained in the Estimates of Appropriations for 2025-26 stand part of the Schedules.\n: Members, we start with the Minister of Finance. The Minister is available to speak to that portfolio from 3 o'clock to 4 o'clock. We may have to look, due to question time, whether that end timeframe is suitable, but I'll keep you informed. I now give the call to the chairperson of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, Cameron Brewer.\nCAMERON BREWER (National—Upper Harbour): Thank you, Madam Speaker. When the Government came to office, we immediately restored fiscal discipline but we also wanted to drive and direct New Zealand's economic recovery. Budget 2025 reinforced and highlighted this Government's priorities and approach.\n: On Budget Day, the Finance Minister's announcement of Investment Boost got a quick and positive response out there in small-business New Zealand. Investment Boost lets businesses deduct 20 percent of the cost of a new asset off their taxable income—on top of depreciation—designed to have both an instant and sustainable hit. In fact, Treasury and Inland Revenue advised at the time that Investment Boost would contribute to GDP growth, wages, and capital stock over time.\n: Secondly, significant KiwiSaver changes. Budget 2025 saw the default rate up, over time, from 3 to 4 percent. The Government contribution for those earning over $180,000 was taken away and the popular extension of contributions was entrenched for 16- and 17-year-olds. A third highlight, for me, was in education: the largest boost in a generation for learning support, meaning more teacher aid hours, learning support coordinators across years 1 and 8, and an overhaul of the Ongoing Resourcing Scheme funding system. Our higher needs kids will finally get the support they need.\n: Budget 2025 backs investment, builds savings, and support where it matters most. My question is to the Minister of Finance and asks: what evidence, on the ground, has she seen that the Investment Boost is indeed making a difference to Kiwi businesses and the wider New Zealand economy?\nTANGI UTIKERE (Labour—Palmerston North): Point of order. Thank you, Madam Chair. I didn't want to interrupt the member. Thank you for your earlier comment about the time. I know that it would be helpful for members on this side of the Chamber to get an indication on whether the Minister was going to go through to the full hour or not.\n: CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Ah, yes. Yes, I was just going to announce that as I called the Minister up to speaker. And we're looking at about 4.12 instead of 4 o'clock. Thank you.\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): I'm pleased to share with the committee that I receive anecdotal feedback on the impact of Investment Boost on a weekly basis—most recently from the MP for Ōtaki, Tim Costley, who shared with me a text message from a small business owner in his community who had felt confident enough to replace their work vehicle as a result of the Investment Boost policy.\n: I do want to make clear to the House that Investment Boost is not a short-term measure; it is a long-term initiative to get more investment for Kiwi businesses, which, of course, happens over many years, not just weeks or months. Right now, firms are facing uncertainty so some of them will have muted investment intentions, but that will change as the economy picks up. The Investment Boost policy is intended to encourage levels of capital investment, which will lead to greater future productivity and greater wage rises.\n: I was also in Australia last week, where I spoke with a range of Australian businesses who were very interested indeed in New Zealand's Investment Boost policy. In the words of the Australian Financial Review, who reported on our policies, \"New Zealand's Minister for finance and economic growth … has stolen a march on Australia by offering a tax break for companies investing across the Tasman.\" That is just another confirmation that this is a very good policy indeed.\nHon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): Thank you, Madam Chair. Despite all the introductory comments by the chair of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, which I understood was meant to be non-political and actually a really good opportunity to go through the actual report, I do want to question the Minister to begin with around some of the responses that she had to that member, because, actually, we have a different view around Budget and the backdrop of Budget.\n: Budget 2025 is that thousands of businesses have shut down, tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs, and people are skipping doctor's visits because they can't actually afford it. The Minister said that she has received a lot of anecdotal data around the support for Investment Boost, including from one further up the line, about 30 minutes away from here. I want to hear from the Minister whether she's actually received any data around the actual uptake of Investment Boost to date, and, if so, can the Minister please share that with the House?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): As previously communicated to that member, we have not received data, because it is very difficult for IRD to disaggregate what investment is a consequence of Investment Boost and what isn't. At the end of the year, of course, we will be able to see how many claims have been made for the Investment Boost policy. I just hope that the member's not changing her tune, because I'm looking at an article from 27 May, in which Barbara Edmonds says the Government's Investment Boost is \"good for business\".\nHon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): Again, it's really great to hear my own words being repeated to me, because I actually know my own words. I also know a bit about tax. So the question I actually have for the Minister is: if she is unable to provide any data to date because it can't be disaggregated, what is the data to date that has not been disaggregated?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): No, it's simply that there isn't any data yet.\nCHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Just before the member asks the next question, the point of this exercise is for members to be able to ask questions to the Minister. There's a lot of shouting coming from the other side, making it difficult for everyone in the Chamber to be able to hear some of the questions.\nHon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): Thank you, Madam Chair. To my next line of questioning: the Prime Minister and both the Minister of Finance, when she appeared before the select committee, had made claims around there being 240,000 more jobs over the forecast period. My question to the Minister is: how many jobs are as a result of that Government policy, and can she provide a specific breakdown of the policy and how many jobs will be created?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Those are just standard Treasury forecasts forecasting the jobs that will be in created in the economy over the forecast period.\nHon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): Therefore, if that's the response from the Minister, we can surmise, therefore, that the Government's claim that they're creating those jobs is actually misleading. Therefore, I'm going to ask the Minister, since you've spoken about those particular 240,000 more jobs and that it's Treasury's forecast: is that, therefore, not the result of the working-age population actually growing by 250 percent? If not, provide a breakdown from Treasury as to why and how they got to 240,000.\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): It's sad, isn't it, when Opposition Members want to quibble about job creation—a thing that I thought both sides of the House could agree is one of the positive things that comes from a consistently growing economy, which is what the Treasury is forecasting and is the basis of that number.\nHon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): It's, again, very interesting to see the modus operandi of this particular Minister of Finance. Instead of providing the detail—because, actually, that's the most important thing: if you want to make a claim that your Government is going to create 240,000 jobs, back it up. Therefore, when I am asking the question to provide the backup, to provide the breakdown—because, actually, my response is, that's only because of population growth—the Minister can only spin around and then basically push it back or what we call \"projection\" on to the Opposition for even asking the question in the first place. That is our job.\n: Therefore, Minister, the question is, the number of people in work has dropped by 36,000 since you took office. Why should Kiwis feel confident about job growth when the number of people in work gets worse and worse?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): That member may take economic growth for granted. I don't, particularly when I think about what would happen if we had a Labour–Te Pāti Māori–Green Party Government that was targeting higher inflation, higher interest rates, and lower growth. There would be less job creation under that policy mix. To the member's question—she's asking about job creation—well, yes—\nRAWIRI WAITITI (Co-Leader—Te Pāti Māori): Point of order, Madam Chair. The Minister of Finance made a comment that Te Pāti Māori was in Government; we were never in Government with the Greens.\nCHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): I think it was wishful thinking—just answering the member's point of order. But I was, while the Minister is actually seated at the moment and not asking a question, going to make the point to the Minister that it's not a session for political attacks; it's a session for asking the questions. Perhaps we'll just start getting things back in order.\nCHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green): E te Māngai, tēnā koe. Tēnā koutou e te Whare. I have a direct question for the Minister of Finance after having gone through all of the documents that have now been released over the past week that the Government was advised on with regard to this Budget. What do you call it, Minister, when the Government makes decisions that it is told will worsen homelessness, deepen child poverty, generate more crime, reduce the quality and quantity of higher education, and increase climate-changing emissions and then you decide to go ahead with all of those things anyway?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, Madam Chair, I'd just simply call that the Green Party's characterisations of the Government's policies.\nCHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green): I would refer members of the public who may be watching along at home to the official information and advice that was given to the Government about the impacts of the decisions that they were intending to make, because, in fact, the information is objective and it is clear.\n: I guess, when this Government is provided with advice that the decisions it intends to make will do all of those negative things for our country and for our society, and the Minister refuses to answer about what that actually means about the shape of this Government, the question we're kind of left with—or, rather, the answer that we're left with—is that this Government is irresponsible or arrogant or, just frankly, incompetent. Is this supposed to be taken as a sign that this Government think that it knows better than everyone, including its own officials, including experts, including economists, including regular hard-working New Zealanders outside of these comfortable walls who can see the country falling apart around their ears as a result of this Government's decisions?\n: Perhaps another question which I hope to get an answer on out of the Minister of Finance: knowing that that was the official advice—that so many things would get so much worse as a result of the Government's merciless cuts and the decisions that it was making—what analysis, if any, did she decide to undertake, perhaps with her social investment hat on, on the costs in the long term of all of these cuts to social service provision?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): I reject the member's characterisation, because, actually, I believe that this Government is pursuing policies that will deliver better housing affordability and less homelessness, in particular because we have the courage to address the underlying driver of unaffordable house prices in this country, which is restrictive green and red tape primarily through the Resource Management Act, which we are replacing—also because we are advancing the fast track regime, which will see subdivisions that that member would say no to go ahead, meaning more housing supply for the country. I reject the characterisation that we're increasing emissions when we've presented a thoughtful Emissions Reduction Plan which shows us achieving our zero carbon targets over that emissions period.\n: To the member's question about cuts, I'd just remind her that we are running a deficit this year of $12 billion, which is one of the largest deficits of countries in the OECD and reflects the fact that the Government is taking a gradual path to fiscal consolidation, in which we are continuing to increase spending in health, in education, in law and order, and in critical public services because we think it's the right thing to do for Kiwi households, businesses, and the economy as a whole. If the member's position is that what the Government should do is just borrow ever more, tax ever more, and spend ever more, and that will solve every problem, I'll just say that I reject that view.\nCHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green): Just responding particularly to that point that the Minister made around the Government's Emissions Reduction Plan, the Minister herself—and, I'm sure, this House and members of the public—will be aware that the Government is currently being sued over its Emissions Reduction Plan because it's not actually worth the paper that it is written on. To that effect, the different decisions that we could see made in this House would be the likes of He Ara Anamata, the Greens' Emissions Reduction Plan, which would see emissions cut six times faster than the Government's so-called plan while reducing the cost of living and increasing quality of life.\n: Another question for the Minister, particularly about our emissions—because there were actually some interesting comments made by her colleagues on a political panel at the Climate Change & Business Conference just yesterday in Tāmaki-makau-rau Auckland—is the Minister going to be budgeting for, or has there been any consideration whatsoever around budgeting for, meeting our Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement, particularly as necessary, unfortunately, for offshore mitigation, which becomes all the higher a cost as a result of the Government reducing its investment in onshore mitigation?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): I have to say, I welcome this member getting back to the environment, because I've never heard her so passionate on that subject. Normally, Palestine is what gets her more passionate. In terms of the specific question that she has asked, look, the Estimates clearly show that we are not forecasting spending billions of dollars offshore to meet the Nationally Determined Contributions which James Shaw signed us up to.\n: To the second part of the question, is it a good thing that we are now in position where gas is diminishing in availability in this country, such that we're having to depend on a mountain of coal to keep the lights on? No, that's not ideal, and so I'd love to wind back time and not ban oil and gas, as Jacinda Ardern and the Greens did—that would be a better position—but, unfortunately, we can't wind back time. This Government is looking at what we can do to shore up confidence in oil and gas exploration.\nHon Dr MEGAN WOODS (Labour—Wigram): Just one question to the Minister of Finance based on her last comment: what is the average time in New Zealand for a new oil and gas field to come into production?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Off the top of my head, it can take up to six years, which imagine if they hadn't banned it—we'd have some new ones on score by now.\n: Hon Dr Megan Woods: No, 10!\nHon NICOLA: WILLIS: Oh, it's 10 according to Megan Woods; I take her at her word.\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Finance): Could it also be the case that, if you knock the stuffing out of an industry, the skilled people leave and the ability to keep production up is reduced in the short term?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, the member makes a good point, but the broader point here is that we have these tears on the other side of the Chamber about how long it's going to take to find gas, which has half the emissions of coal, when they're the ones that banned the gas exploration in the first place. This is a wonderful come-to-Muhammad moment, because, actually, the reality is that Megan Woods, the member who asked that question, was the one who went out there, banned oil and gas and set our electricity prices soaring, which led to a coal mountain at Huntly—well done.\nHon Dr MEGAN WOODS (Labour—Wigram): Thank you, Madam Chair. Given the Minister's comments that she's just made, which are factually incorrect in many ways, I'd just like to reiterate that the Labour Party has absolutely no intention of bringing back the ability to explore for oil and gas. But what I would like to ask the Minister is how much money was invested in existing New Zealand oil and gas fields between 2018 and 2023, since the Minister is talking about there being capital flight in her comments.\n: CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): I think we're going backwards instead of forward. Is there a way the member can rephrase that question?\nHon Dr MEGAN WOODS: Sure. So given the Minister has allowed two hundred million dollars to co-invest in oil and gas fields in the Budget that we are debating, what is the level of investment that happened—did she take advice on the level of investment that happened between 2018 and 2023, and how did that compare to the five years of investment in existing fields before that?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, I didn't take advice on this matter because, due to the management of conflicts of interest and in alignment with the Cabinet Manual, I was not involved in Cabinet discussions relating to this matter.\nCHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green): It felt appropriate to respond, given that the Minister, in attempting to answer my questions, threw back some quite nasty stuff. So I just want to make it crystal clear that genocide is a biodiversity and climate disaster—in fact, more military intervention and more war results in all the more climate-changing emissions, which result in an all the more unliveable planet for everybody, including New Zealanders. I also just wanted to further dig into the point that was raised by the Hon Dr Megan Woods, particularly about the decisions that this Government has chosen to undertake. The $200 million subsidy for new fossil fuel production in this country comes with an opportunity cost—\n: Ryan Hamilton: It's not a subsidy—co-investment.\nCHLÖE SWARBRICK: To the point that is being heckled at me right now, I have put multiple Official Information Act requests, parliamentary written questions, and oral questions—both to Minster Todd McClay and to the Prime Minister—asking for any clear and explicit evidence that it is not a subsidy. Because, in fact, we have clear and explicit evidence that it is a subsidy. So can the Minister now stand and tell us that it is not a subsidy and provide the evidence behind that assertion? Because if not, in the absence of that evidence, it very clearly is a subsidy for new fossil fuel production. That's my first question.\n: My second question is: did she, or her team, or anyone in Cabinet, do any form of investigation into the opportunity cost with investing this $200 million subsidy into new fossil fuel production, and what, for example, we could have achieved in terms of resilience in our energy system, with that money going into the likes of renewable energy?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Can I just sincerely say to the member that when it comes to the situation in Gaza, I think we can both agree that we are both equally appalled by the loss of life and the devastating events that are occurring there. For me, it's more about children dying than biodiversity, but I think we can both agree that we're both concerned by that.\n: Now, in terms of the questions that are relating to the energy policy in the Budget, I'm going to invite the member to put those questions to Minister Bishop, who is the Minister who took those decisions on my behalf.\nHon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): Thank you, Madam Chair. Where I want to go with this line of questioning is in relation to reprioritisations, as the Minister would say. What we have seen progressively across the country since this Government came into power is a worsening of our public services and a health system that is increasingly under pressure. The question is: is meeting her fiscal objectives, as she has set out in the Budget documents, more important than funding the services that people need?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): We can do both.\nHon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): Treasury advised that, in order to meet her fiscal strategy—and it was released under an Official Information Act request for a report that was dated December 2024. It was only released after a complaint to the Ombudsman. That advice said that, in order for the Minister to meet her fiscal strategy, it will require constraining expenditure growth—it will require \"significant structural changes to how these services are funded and delivered. All such choices rely on either reducing access to health and education services, an implied reduction in their quality, or historically large increases in productivity.\" Does this not explicitly say that she plans to degrade services in health and education?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): No, it doesn't say that, and I congratulate the member on catching up with a report that was first released around, I think, a month ago. What that report does is look 15 years ahead. What we set out very clearly in the forecasts that this Budget debate relates to is that, over the next four years, the Government will achieve its fiscal strategy by getting Government spending as a proportion of GDP down, getting the debt curve bending down, getting us back to surplus, and all the while increasing funding for health and education. We have left more than enough headroom over the next few Budgets to increase spending for health and education, and I'm quite happy to commit to that member that, for so long as I am finance Minister, there will be more funding for health and education. The hopeless scaremongering and the latter discovery of an OIA request doesn't make any of that untrue.\nHon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): Therefore, in relation to the Minister's response, will the funding for health and education meet both inflation and population growth?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): I want first to acknowledge that Chris Bishop is in the House. Both Megan Woods and Chlöe Swarbrick put questions around oil and gas, which I think he will be happy to address, and it is appropriate that he probably does so at the appropriate juncture. In terms of funding for health and education, I'd note that the health funding that we provided in this Budget increases health spending as a proportion of GDP and, I understand, goes beyond demographic pressures. In terms of education, of course, that relates not just to the overall population but demographics in the age group of those going to school.\nHon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): In summary of the Minister's response, is it correct, therefore, that she is not committing to increasing health funding by inflation and age demographics?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): No, that is not correct. I'm saying that there are different ways of measuring that, and I'm not going to be held to the member's way of measuring it. She's the one who'd measure inflation by making it go higher.\nHon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): Therefore—because the Minister, again, likes to spin it and turn it around to attack members on this side of the House, as to comments that we've made, which is not her responsibility—will she confirm one more time for the record, for everybody else who is outside of this House, who are asking the same question, that while she if the Minister of Finance she will not be increasing health funding for both inflation and age demographics?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): I have literally just addressed that question.\n: Hon Dr Megan Woods: Madam Chair?\nCHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Is this a new question, because is Minister Bishop going to answer the previous question?\n: Hon Dr Megan Woods: It's a new question.\nCHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): OK, well we'll take the Hon Megan Woods first because it's probably on the same thing.\nHon Dr MEGAN WOODS (Labour—Wigram): No, it's not. I'd like to ask the Minister of Finance some questions around Working for Families and FamilyBoost. Minister, when you came to select committee, we heard that 153 families to date had received the maximum $75 that they were eligible for under FamilyBoost. What is the updated figure?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): I can confirm that every family who has applied for FamilyBoost has got the full entitlement to which they are entitled, which was based on the campaign commitments made by the National Party during the campaign.\nHon Dr MEGAN WOODS (Labour—Wigram): I asked the Minister what the updated number was. We heard at select committee: 153 families had received that number. What is the number as of today?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, the member misses the point. I missed the characterisation in her question which is that the full entitlement is as she characterises it.\n: Hon Barbara Edmonds: Check your notes.\nHon NICOLA: WILLIS: Actually, the policy has always been very clear—Barbara Edmonds—that the amount of rebate depends on how much people spend on childcare fees each fortnight. So they have to spend $300 a week to get the maximum a fortnight, and they have to earn under the maximum income threshold. So all families who meet those criteria have indeed got a rebate of $250. So the member's question is misleading in that it's claiming that it's only a full rebate if it is that amount, when, in fact, we were always clear that the rebate related to how much had been spent on childcare fees and the income level, and IRD have worked tirelessly—tirelessly—to ensure that people get the correct rebate according to their circumstances.\nCHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Can I just clarify, because I'm not sure that the member asked about the full rebate, so—\nHon Dr MEGAN WOODS (Labour—Wigram): Speaking to your point, Madam Chair—not off our time—you're absolutely correct. I wasn't asking about the elusive $250 FamilyBoost; I was asking about how many families who had received up to the maximum of the FamilyBoost payment—\n: CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Up to their maximum?\nHon Dr MEGAN: WOODS: Yeah, their maximum; 153 was the number that the Minister of Finance reported at select committee, and was the updated number as of today. If the Minister doesn't have that number, that's fine; we'll put the question in writing.\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, when you go back and check the Hansard, you'll see that the word \"maximum\" wasn't used in her earlier questions; she's inserted that later. I can confirm that more than 60,000 families have received their full entitlement for the FamilyBoost payment.\nHon CHRIS BISHOP (Minister of Housing): I do want to—I understand that—\n: Hon Dr Megan Woods: The cavalry, huh?\nHon CHRIS: BISHOP: Well, I understand—well, you asked some questions, which I'm now here to answer. I wasn't here. So I'm happy to—[Interruptions] Well, you literally asked some questions. I'm now here to answer those questions. And we're now getting complaints about answering questions. [Interruption]\nDEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! I understand Minister Bishop's come to answer some questions around the gas—\nHon CHRIS: BISHOP: Yeah. My understanding is there were some questions around the oil and gas contribution in the Budget in the Estimates. I'm happy to answer those questions and actually hear them, but I suspect I know what they are. From Chlöe Swarbrick there'll be the allegation it's a subsidy and possibly the same line of questioning from the Hon Megan Woods. The Government has set aside a contingency in Budget 20—\n: Hon Dr Megan Woods: How can he answer questions when he doesn't even know what they are?\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Well, he's referred to the fact that the questions were: is it a subsidy and the other question talked about the opportunity cost compared to energy and resilience. So if we make that the starting point.\nHon CHRIS: BISHOP: Oh, so having asked questions, you now don't want answers. Righto. Well, we now have an understanding of the Labour Party approach to everything, which is—[Interruption]\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Quiet! Order! Order!\nHon CHRIS: BISHOP: —just speculate and fulminate wildly and then not actually want questions. A bit like their approach to inflation.\n: Hon Dr Megan Woods: It's not the vibe of the thing; it's actually a question and answer.\nHon CHRIS: BISHOP: Ah, the vibe of the thing. Yes, a bit like the vibe of KiwiBuild building 100,000 houses, which that member was responsible for and was a disaster.\n: So the Government has set aside $200 million in the Budget as a—[Interruption]\n: DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, please! I can't hear!\nHon CHRIS: BISHOP: —contingency which will be drawn down upon the publication of a business case by the Minister for Resources. The reason the Government has set aside that money is because of the disastrous policies between 2018 and 2023. And it's a good faith attempt to deal with the lack of security of supply for gas in the New Zealand energy system. The simple reality is we need gas and we need people exploring for gas. Every member, I think, is familiar with the challenges around the insecurity of gas supply. So the Government has put $200 million aside so that Government can take a stake—\n: Hon Dr Megan Woods: This is ridiculous. Are National so desperate they had to soak up time like this?\nHon CHRIS: BISHOP: The member literally asked questions.\nHon CHRIS BISHOP (Associate Minister of Finance): Which is that the Government has set aside this money so that we can become a potential co-investor in new gasfields to try and reduce the sovereign risk that has occurred to New Zealand because of the disastrous policies of the previous Government. Now, having repealed the oil and gas ban, we've got that into place, but there are clearly people out there in the world who look at New Zealand and say, \"Well, hang on a minute, if the cowboys on the other side get back in, what are we going to do?\" So we need an ability to make sure that people have some of their investments de-risked, and one way of doing that—and, frankly, if it was over to me, in a personal sense, we wouldn't be doing it, but one way of de-risking that investment is for the Crown to take a stake in oil- and gasfields, gasfields being the major focus, obviously; that being the cause of concern. So we are working our way through that between the Minister for Resources and myself, as Associate Minister of Finance, and when we have announcements to make, we will do that. It is not a subsidy, and it cannot be a subsidy if the Government has a commercial stake in a field. It's just—\n: Chlöe Swarbrick: Yes, you can—yes, you can.\nHon CHRIS: BISHOP: Well, you're wrong about that, with respect—it's just an investment.\nCHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green): I'm really glad that the Minister is here now and engaging directly with this, because I would like to know and to understand what specific advice he has had with regard to the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade, and Sustainability (ACCTS), with regards to its definition of a subsidy. This is what I've been trying to get answers to over a series of months, in direct questions to the trade Minister, to the Prime Minister, in Official Information Act requests, and in parliamentary written questions—just to understand what the evidential basis is that allows the Minister to make those assertions that this is not a subsidy. Because the World Trade Organization defines a \"subsidy\", effectively, as a form of investment, whether that be co-investment or just taxpayer money being used and put into something that the private sector would not do by itself. By that definition, this is a subsidy.\n: I would like to ask the Minister—I know that he's been dismissing, as many other Ministers in this Cabinet have been, the advice that we commissioned, because we have been unable to get access to anything that this Government has used to make its decision—whether he's engaged in or looked at the independent King's Counsel advice that we commissioned, in order to get some clarity around this definition of subsidy?\nHon CHRIS BISHOP (Associate Minister of Finance): Sure, I'm happy to address that. It's a good question from the member. As I think the member well knows, the Government doesn't release privileged legal advice as a matter of course, so we won't be doing that. But let me just reason it for the member in this way: the Government owns 51 percent of Meridian Energy—it is a listed company, but the Government owns 51 percent of it—Meridian investing in a new wind farm, that is not a subsidy; that is just an investment. So if the Government sets up a separate company on the Crown balance sheet, as a Schedule 4 company, for example, or through another vehicle that's owned by the Crown, and the Crown takes a stake in a gasfield—say a 10 percent stake with a co-investment from a range of private sector partners—that is not a subsidy; that that's just an investment.\n: It's the same as Meridian investing in a wind farm or Genesis investing in a particular type of power station or Kānoa investing in a range of infrastructure investments through the Regional Infrastructure Fund up and down the country, for example. The Crown investing in something is not a subsidy; it's just an investment. I know the member doesn't like gas, but she needs to divorce her views on gas from the basic—\n: Ryan Hamilton: Maths.\nHon CHRIS BISHOP: Yeah—basic maths and basic economics.\nCHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green): Just further to that point, if I may, Madam Chair, I just want to be crystal clear with the Minister that this is not a matter of my personal opinion. This is about the definition of what is considered a fossil fuel subsidy under the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade, and Sustainability. All of my personal opinions about the need for us to act with pace to address the climate crisis aside, this is about, very literally, the words in a trade agreement which this Government championed signing, after five years of negotiation, with a press release from Minister Todd McClay in November of last year.\n: In the advice that we have received—because, again, we are yet to get any insight into the evidentiary basis on which the Government is standing and consistently declaring this is not a subsidy—and the information that we have, is that this is a subsidy per article 4.3(2)(b)(i), because, firstly, \"the financial contribution\"—that being the subsidy under the definition of the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade, and Sustainability—\"is primarily targeting the … exploration, extraction, refining, [and] processing … of fossil fuels\", which the Minister would not disagree with. And secondly, because it \"reduces the costs of such activities or increases revenues retained by [the co-investors, who are the] actors engaged therein\". Based on those two premises, on those principles, this meets the definition of a subsidy under the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade, and Sustainability. So I'd just really like to understand how the Minister can consistently say the opposite, when he has not addressed the definition and the ACCTS.\nHon CHRIS BISHOP (Associate Minister of Finance): Well, I don't have a huge amount more to add to what I've already said, which is, respectfully—and I appreciate that the member is engaging in this in good faith, and it is a complicated issue—the Government, via an investment vehicle that is owned by the Crown, investing in a new gasfield, alongside private sector co-investment, is just an investment. It would be different if the Government was going along and saying, \"We are going to pay you money in order to do something.\" We're not doing that. It's a co-investment on commercial terms, and that's the way—I mean, it's subject to detailed design, and we haven't yet drawn down the contingency, so I caveat my remarks by saying that, and Minister Jones is leading on this, alongside me, and working hard on that. But that's not the intention of the policy design and, therefore, it is not a subsidy. The Government remains really confident in its view that it is not. I know the member has legal advice to the contrary, but respectfully, we disagree.\nHon GINNY ANDERSEN (Labour): Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I have a couple of questions around jobs and economic growth in that space. According to the quarterly business employment data, there has been no job growth since the Minister took office. I'm just wondering if she's got any idea why there are 10,560 fewer jobs in the past three months?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): I'm very happy to take the member back to the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update, which forecast what unemployment would be at this time in the economy under the settings left by the last Government, and I'm happy to confirm that those numbers are higher than what has occurred under this Government.\nHon GINNY ANDERSEN (Labour): Specifically, what is her plan for the 19,842 more 15- to 24-year-olds who no longer are in work? Is there any specific plan for that demographic, which seems to be disproportionately represented in the unemployment statistics that have been coming out month on month? I would also like to highlight that there have been 15 consecutive months now where jobs have fallen every quarter—and that is five quarters now—but my question is specific to the 19,842 more young people who no longer have work.\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): It's of concern to this Government to see any young person unemployed and on a benefit, because it's our view that every young person who cannot find a job should take up the State's generous provision of taxpayer-funded education that is available to them in the tertiary education system. When it comes to those aged 15, 16, and 17, they should be at school. When they are older, they are able to enter State-subsidised tertiary education of a range of different types, and that's why, in this Budget, we've advanced a policy for 18- and 19-year-olds where we've said, look, actually, we'd prefer that young people were either in work, training, or education and, if they're not, we actually want their parents ensuring that they take up those options. That is why we have put forward a policy to ensure that 18- and 19-year-olds don't automatically get a Jobseeker benefit but that their circumstances are tested against the income of their parents.\nHon GINNY ANDERSEN (Labour): I'm just interested in her views on workers falling behind in terms of the cost of living. We know that there has been about a 1.5 percent increase in wages—that's not, clearly, keeping up with the 2.7 percent of inflation. On top of that, we have approximately a 10 percent increase in administrative inflation, which is all those additional fees and costs that Kiwis now have to bear, such as road-user charges, such as being able to go to tertiary institutions, such as going to a doctor—even the Government's commitment to help out and co-fund water infrastructure, which they've now backed out on, which is causing rates to go up. There's been all of these administrative charges on top of the fact that wages are only increasing at 1.5 percent. What is her response to working Kiwi families who find their weekly costs going up and up, and they do not have that extra money in their back pocket that she promised them?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): My response to those families is that this Government is working hard every day to get on top of the cost of living for you. That is why we are so focused on strengthening the fundamentals of this economy, because we understand that, when inflation is allowed to get out of control, that drives price increases across the economy that affect every family. That's why we target an inflation rate of 2 percent—between 1 and 3 percent, with 2 percent at the midpoint—and why we reject those who argue for a higher inflation rate that would lead to faster price increases and a higher cost of living. That is why, in this Budget, we advanced the Investment Boost policy, which we were advised would increase wage growth and increase growth in the economy, because we wish to see that. That's why we are on the side of businesses who wish to create jobs and who wish to lift incomes, and why we are so intent on reforms that will allow that to happen.\nHon GINNY ANDERSEN (Labour): Does she accept that administered inflation last month hitting 10.8 percent has been done under her watch? Under her Government, we have seen increases to road-user charges, to all of those weekly fees that come into Kiwis' bank accounts. Will she accept that it is the cuts in Government spending, and pushing those costs out into the community for the weekly budget to pick up, that has actually made the cost of living crisis worse for those New Zealand families, and does she accept that all of those increased fees and levies have gone up under her watch?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): As I traversed in question time today, the biggest rise in administered costs is rates rises, and, actually, the decisions that individual councils make to increase their rates are their decisions. So, no, I don't take responsibility, for example, for Wellington City Council's rates increase, because, if I were leading that council, it would be a lot more careful with its money, which is why the Government is looking into our ability to, through legislation and policy, have a little bit more influence on the rates that councils levy. It is the case that, when rates go up as fast as they have in recent times, it has a very profound impact on the cost of living for New Zealanders. That's of great concern to this Government. It is that member's side of the House that have outright rejected doing anything to control rates rises.\nHon GINNY ANDERSEN (Labour): Does she stand by her pre-election promise that National will co-invest in water infrastructure?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, we already are. The Regional Infrastructure Fund (RIF), under Shane Jones' watch, is investing in stopbanks and all sorts of protections for flooding and the like.\nCAMILLA BELICH (Labour): The Minister hasn't made any comments about pay equity yet, so I wanted to ask her: some recent documents have been made public on the pay equity changes. In those documents, officials said that, on their analysis of the proposals because of the short time frame, they raised concerns about unintended consequences. Today, we've only seen one union raise a pay equity claim. I want to ask her: was that an unintended consequence or an intended consequence, given that David Seymour has said that these pay equity changes saved her Budget?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, Mr we fully expect and expected that there will be claims made under the new pay equity regime, and such was the completeness of that expectation that I, in this Budget, have put aside funds in contingency needed to address future claims.\nCAMILLA BELICH (Labour): How much money has she put aside in contingency to address future claims?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, I would hope that that member would be informed enough to know that revealing that quantum would prejudice the Crown's negotiating position.\nHon MARK PATTERSON (NZ First): Minister, I note that, in one of your early answers, you referenced the increase to the KiwiSaver contributions that you brought in during Budget 2025. I've heard some other supportive commentary around that during the week and taking that even further, but could you give us your thinking behind why it's important that we grow our savings pool in this country?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Thank you, Mr Chair, for the question. Yes, that's right: this Budget supports a lift to 8 percent for KiwiSaver contributions from employers and employees. I'm aware that the leader of the member's own party has advocated for that to go further in future.\n: It is the case that, when people contribute more to their KiwiSaver fund, that accumulates massively over time and can afford them a high living standard in retirement. It's also the case that countries that have private pension schemes of that sort have more capital available to be deployed in those economies. In New Zealand's case, with around 30 percent of KiwiSaver funds currently invested here in New Zealand, growing pools of KiwiSaver savings means that there could be more options in future for New Zealand - based investment in New Zealand - based jobs, growth, industry, and activity. I think that's a very good thing.\nINGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): Just some quick back and forth, if I may, Mr Chair. Does she accept that the cost pressures of the mental health sector are likely to be the same whether directly funded through Health New Zealand or in the funded sector; if so, how?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Sorry, can the member repeat the question?\nINGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): Does she accept that the cost pressures of the mental health sector are likely to be the same whether they are funded directly through Health New Zealand or whether they are funded as the funded sector, and, if so, how does she justify that there could be a difference in those cost pressures?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, it is simply the case that when the Government negotiates contracts with service providers, all sorts of factors go into the final price that the Government pays.\nINGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): Would she then expect that there would be modelling to be able to show—and evidence—what the difference in the cost pressures would be to justify the difference in uplifts?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, look, I think that these questions relate more specifically to Vote health, which the member in this Estimates debate will have the opportunity to address with the appropriate Minister. But what I'd say is that it's been the practice of successive Governments that we don't reveal information that would prejudice the Crown's commercial position.\nINGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): Would it be her expectation that the Minister in charge would have access to that modelling? I say these comments because we do have burnt out mental health sectors and we have people going to Australia; we have pay equity claims that have been cut in 33 sectors including mental health, so it's important to understand what level of evidence and modelling the Minister would find acceptable when approving the budgets from the health Minister.\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, I don't know what modelling the member is referring to; what I can say is that the overall funding uplift we provided for health was based on Treasury modelling about demographics and inflation. That was the modelling that informed Labour's commitments in their fiscal plan prior to the election. We exceeded those commitments and built on them further in this Budget—so we increased them even further. That despite that fact that forecast inflation is lower than was expected.\nHon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): Thank you, Mr Chair. Just going back to the Minister of Finance's response in relation to my question of whether she stands by her statement that she was advised on 24 February by the Secretary to the Treasury that employment discussions had commenced between Adrian Orr and the Reserve Bank board, I just want to confirm from the Minister: is it that she's not prepared to answer that question or she has not prepared to answer that question, given that this is on page 5 of the select committee report? So, again, I'll ask the question: does she stand by that statement?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Look, it's simply that I want to give an accurate answer. The member's put the question on notice, and I'm happy to address it when I can do so accurately.\nCAMILLA BELICH (Labour): Does the Minister have any plans to address the pay for care and support workers, given that she cancelled their claim and made it so they are unable to raise another claim until 2026, given that many of them are on the minimum wage now during a cost of living crisis?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, care and support workers, as with any workforce group, if they meet the criteria of the pay equity regime—which is a legal judgment and not a judgment for me to make—would be able to put forward a pay equity claim.\nINGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): Thank you—just a supplementary to that question from my colleague Camilla Belich. Has the Minister done any modelling on how many care and support workers from New Zealand, out of the 60,000 that have had their pay equity claim cut, have gone to Australia, given that a level 4 pay equity worker in New Zealand gets between $26 and $28 and in Australia can earn between $33 and $44, and given that the Australians gave an uplift of 30 percent over the last three years, compared to New Zealand?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): No, but I would observe that, across the economy, Australia is a wealthier economy that has grown faster than New Zealand for some years, which means it is in a position to pay its people more across many professions. That's why I have an aspiration to grow this economy faster, to have a more productive economy that can afford to pay its workers more. It's simply the case that wealthier countries pay their workers more. That's exactly why I want this to be a wealthier country.\nHon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): So, therefore, in relation to that response and in relation to her response during question time where she said that New Zealand's growth will outstrip Australia, will she therefore revisit her decision and ensure that if care and support workers—because the Government does the funding; an element of that funding—will she ensure that it's above the Australian growth?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): I'd hope that that member would understand that it's going to take more than a year or two of faster growth than Australia for us to make up for the around 30 percent gap between Australia and New Zealand. We're going to need successive years of that. The best way to achieve that would be for Labour to never get elected ever again.\nCAMILLA BELICH (Labour): Given the Minister's answer in relation to pay equity claims, has she done any analysis about the value that giving low-paid workers pay equity claims would give back to the economy in terms of increased spending and how that may impact New Zealand's economic position?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): You can do whatever model you like, but if a country can't afford something and borrows forever to deliver it, then ultimately that country goes bankrupt.\nINGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): How does the Minister intend to fill the sector gaps in care and support work for an aging population when we already have a burnt-out workforce, we have workers going to Australia for higher pay, and we do not have immigration policies that will meet the demand and, in fact, are competing with Australia, which is why Australia have given a 30 percent uplift to their workers? How does the Minister plan to address that gap? Can she tell us how that is at all value for money and cost effective? And what immigration policies and other levers is she using given that we are not going to be able to get the workforce in our own country?\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Similar to this member's previous questions, she is asking what I think are important questions about the aged care sector and its workforce. Those are questions that are more appropriately put to the relevant Ministers of health in their Estimates debate.\nCHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Members, the Minister of Finance's time in the chair has come to an end. We now have the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. The Minister is available to speak to that portfolio from 4.13 p.m. until 5.13 p.m. I call Dr Parmjeet Parmar, but we'll just wait until the Minister is ensconced in his seat before we start our time. Thank you, Minister.\n: Commerce and Consumer Affairs\nDr PARMJEET PARMAR (: Chairperson of the Economic Development, Science and Innovation Committee): Thank you, Mr Chair. As the chair of the Economic Development, Science and Innovation Committee, it's a pleasure to take the committee of the whole House through the hearing that we held with the Hon Scott Simpson, the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE).\n: I'll just go through the main points that we discussed in the select committee. The select committee noted that the Government is seeking $303.3 million for the Commerce and Consumer Affairs appropriation, which is slightly below the previous year's estimated actual expenditure of $304.2 million.\n: We focused on the Minister's strategic intention and it was quite clear that the Minister is quite focused on encouraging a lot of commercial activity, encouraging competition in commercial activity, so that our economy could grow. The Minister also mentioned that he is quite keen on seeing that we are able to provide easier access to capital. Along with these things, we also discussed various legislations which are in progress, some of which have been already passed like the Contracts of Insurance Act 2024. We discussed the Customer and Product Data Act 2025, Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Amendment Bill, and the review of the Companies Act, as well.\n: In the review of the Commerce Commission discussion, questions were asked about the review that has been done, including the external review, and the Minister noted that the work that the Commerce Commission does is good, but it needs to be fit for purpose. Open banking was another topic where there was a lot of support from members on the committee, and there was a lot of interest to see how it's going to work. We heard that MBIE is actually formalising the regulatory system to enable open banking to happen.\n: Charging fees for access to customer data was an issue that came up, and we noted in the committee that process is still under consideration. Changes to the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act came up. There was quite a bit of focus on retrospective changes there, and the Minister presented his side—the advice that the Minister had received—which led to that decision.\n: Finally, in the short call, I would just like to highlight that another important issue that was discussed in the committee was about scams. This was to understand what the Minister is doing to reduce scam activities that happen which target people in all age groups, especially elderly people, as well. The Minister told the committee that this is something that needs to be looked at an international level and the Minister is keeping a very close eye on what's happening internationally so that we can see how we can also strengthen our anti-scam provisions here in New Zealand.\n: So, overall, I would say that it was a really great hearing and I want to acknowledge the Minister, I want to acknowledge MBIE officials, and I also want to acknowledge all the members on the committee for really good scrutiny of the Minister and the officials. Thank you, Mr Chair.\nHon Dr DUNCAN WEBB (Labour—Christchurch Central): Just a couple of brief points, if I may. First of all, I'd be interested to know whether the Minister will be reinstituting the Consumer Advocacy Council that has been disbanded under this Government, which is a watchdog for consumers in the electricity market, given that electricity prices are skyrocketing and this Government isn't doing anything about it.\n: I'd also be interested to know whether the Minister is going to correct his statement in the House when he said that there was \"overwhelmingly positive feedback\" about his PayWave initiative and whether, in fact, he is taking into account the three positive pieces of feedback or the 30 negative pieces of feedback about that. I'd be particularly interested to know whether he is reconsidering his position or what he is doing to ensure that the PayWave increases are not passed on to consumers.\n: Does he agree with the feedback given to him that this is one of the most stupid moves any Government could make, or the feedback that said, \"less choice\", \"less personal responsibility\", \"more cost for me\", a \"badly thought-out populist policy\"? The point being that many consumers that he said were positive are, in fact, concerned that this current Government initiative will see PayWave fees pushed into the price of goods that all consumers will have to bear, and, in fact, it will be the opposite of transparent pricing; it will hide PayWave fees in prices.\nHon SCOTT SIMPSON (Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs): In answer to the member's first question: no. But, look, on this side of the House, we take a range of feedback and balanced feedback from a range of sources. The member is referring to, I think, 30 pieces of interaction that I had received. Now, usually, in situations where there is going to be a positive change, there are sometimes those who are detractors, and I noticed that in his party, they are often detractors for positive change.\n: So the short answer to his question is no, we're going to push on with the surcharge ban. We've said that it will be in place by May next year at the latest, but certainly earlier if we can do it, because New Zealanders deserve to have a regime and the confidence that the price they see for something on the shelf should be the price they pay at the checkout and at the till.\nREUBEN DAVIDSON (Labour—Christchurch East): Thank you, Mr Chair. On 20 May, the Minister quietly announced that the Government had decided to discharge the Digital Services Tax Bill from the legislative programme. As a result of taking this action, the forecast revenues from the introduction of a digital services tax no longer meet the criteria for inclusion in the Crown accounts. Reporting states that financial statements filed by tech firms including Google, Facebook, and Amazon show how they're moving their local profits to tax havens like Ireland, allowing them to declare little or no taxable revenue in New Zealand. Treasury's own Estimates were that a digital services tax would have pulled in $479 million from these firms over the next four years. Because of the Minister's decision, these firms will now continue paying minimal tax. Why, during a cost of living crisis and in the face of ongoing cuts to public services, is the Minister happy to write off $500 million in tax revenue?\nHon SCOTT SIMPSON (Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs): With the greatest respect, the member just resuming his seat is a new member. He has entirely the wrong portfolio. These are questions to be put to the Minister of Revenue.",

This is a particular case of recent occurrence for which there is ministerial responsibility. However, I do not think it reaches the level that warrants setting aside the business of the House today. The application is declined.I've also received a letter from the Hon Barbara Edmonds seeking to debate, under Standing Order 399, the resignation of the chair of the Reserve Bank. This is a particular case of recent occurrence for which there is ministerial responsibility. Not all resignations are debated and it is unusual to debate the resignation of someone who is not a Minister. This matter is one that would be better explored through questions to the Minister rather than through an urgent debate. I'm not convinced that it requires the immediate attention of the House. The application is declined.\n\nORAL QUESTIONSQUESTIONS TO MINISTERSQuestion No. 1—Finance1. RYAN HAMILTON (National—Hamilton East) to the Minister of Finance: What recent reports has she seen on the economy?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): I saw an interesting report from Westpac recently, comparing the economic outlooks of New Zealand and Australia. A bit of healthy rivalry is a feature of the trans-Tasman relationship, so I was pleased to see Westpac—which operates on both sides of the ditch—saying that economic growth in New Zealand is set to outpace Australia, over the next few years. Westpac is forecasting annual GDP growth in New Zealand to accelerate to 2.4 percent by the end of the year, and 3.1 percent by the end of 2026. That is higher growth than the bank is forecasting for Australia. When Westpac looks at per capita—that is, per person—growth, the difference between the two countries is even greater. Ryan Hamilton: What is supporting this growth in the New Zealand economy?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: Consistent with other forecasters, Westpac says that growth in New Zealand will be underpinned by reductions in the official cash rate (OCR) transmitting through the economy. A lower OCR leads to lower interest rates for households and businesses, who respond by spending and investing more. Westpac also points out that increases in New Zealand's commodity export prices will boost incomes and spending—thank you, farmers. It says that international demand for hard commodities—which Australia exports—is easing, while global demand for dairy and other food products—which New Zealand exports—remains firm. Ryan Hamilton: How are interest rate reductions flowing through the economy?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: The Reserve Bank has reduced the OCR by 250 basis points over the past year, taking it down to 3 percent so far. Markets are pricing in two more reductions. Westpac makes the point that around 90 percent of mortgage lending in New Zealand is on fixed rates, compared to only around 10 to 15 percent of Australian mortgage lending. That means that interest rate changes take around 12 to 24 months to pass through the New Zealand economy. The transmission of lower interest rates is therefore still under way, with rate reductions only having begun a year ago—45 percent of mortgage lending is either floating or is due to be reprised within the next six months, which is good news for those coming on to lower interest rates. Ryan Hamilton: What is the outlook for New Zealand exports?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: The global outlook suggests that demand for New Zealand exports will remain high despite tariffs; strength in global commodity prices—particularly dairy and meat prices—is supporting farm incomes and rural confidence. The ANZ Commodity Price Index in world prices rose again in August and is 9.3 percent higher than it was a year ago. Recent data shows that New Zealand's goods terms of trade—that is, the prices we get for our exports relative to the prices we pay for imports—is at a record high, in a series that goes all the way back to the 1950s. So New Zealand's purchasing power in the world has risen, and that is good news for our households and businesses. Hon Chris Bishop: What reports has the Minister seen on inflation targeting?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: I have seen a report that there are spokespeople in this Parliament, open to having a discussion about changing the Reserve Bank's inflation target to allow inflation to run hotter. I'm happy to rule out—SPEAKER: Probably—Hon NICOLA WILLIS: —the Government won't be letting price increases—SPEAKER: That's probably where you should leave it.\n\nQuestion No. 2—Acting Prime Minister2. Rt Hon CHRIS HIPKINS (Leader of the Opposition) to the Acting Prime Minister: Does he stand by all his Government's statements and actions?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR (Acting Prime Minister): Yes, and particularly the Government introducing legislation which has led to New Zealanders up and down this country being able to vote on whether their councils should have Māori wards. Having the same basic democratic rights and duties, regardless of background, is a critical cornerstone of our democracy. And now, thanks to this Government, New Zealanders up and down the country will get to have a say about whether that is the policy in their council.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Who speaks for the Government: the Prime Minister who says he wants modest, consistent house price increases, or the housing Minister who says that it's good that house prices are dropping and the Government is trying to drive house prices down?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: The facts are that the Government cannot set house prices, and I would be alarmed if any party in this House had that as their plan. What the Government is doing is introducing policies that will make it easier for New Zealanders to build more homes, and in that sense both of them are speaking for the Government because the final track of housing will depend on a range of factors. What we're doing is fixing what matters through Resource Management Act reform, Building Act reform, infrastructure funding, so that wages can grow faster than house prices, which is what we should all want for New Zealand's future.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: So is it the Government's goal for house prices to go up or down?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: We seem to be having a communication or comprehension problem on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition. My previous answer clearly stated that the Government's goal is to make it easier to build a home. We're doing Resource Management Act reform—wonderful work by Chris Bishop and Simon Court; we are doing Building Act reform—wonderful work by Chris Penk, the Minister for Building and Construction; and we are doing infrastructure funding and finance reform across a range of portfolios. Now, what that means is that it is easier and more affordable to build a home, and that means the next generation has ladders of opportunity to be part of a property-owning democracy, something that got further and further into the distance under the previous Government's housing inflation.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Point of order, Mr Speaker. I don't think anyone will be any the wiser as to whether or not the Government's position is that house prices should go up or down as a result of that answer.SPEAKER: Well—Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: I'm happy to repeat the question if the member has a comprehension problem with it.SPEAKER: No, no. You can ask—Hon David Seymour: Problem's all yours, buddy.SPEAKER: When I'm speaking, no one else is. You can most certainly use your supplementaries to ask another question if you wish, but you can't ask me to judge the quality of the question. That's never been the case.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Was Chris Bishop wrong when he said, \"The Government is trying to drive house prices down.\"?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: No, he was not, because as I have explained and will now explain for the third time—I suspect the rest of New Zealand's got it, but for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition—many of the policies that the Government is introducing are policies that will increase the supply elasticity of housing and that will, other things being equal, make it more affordable. However, it is also true that as New Zealand's economy grows under the policy of this Government, as New Zealanders become wealthier, as they bid higher prices for housing, they may well end up pushing prices up.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: So was Christopher Luxon wrong when he said that the Government wants, \"modest, consistent house price increases\"?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: It reminds me of when I used to tutor Econ 101. Let me explain to the Leader of the Opposition: on the one hand, we want New Zealanders to be wealthier, we want our population to grow, we want people to be bidding to raise house prices, but on the other hand, we want to make it easier to build them. Both of us want economic growth, less red tape, less regulation, and I just wish that the Leader of the Opposition would get on board.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: So who speaks for the Government on housing intensification: David Seymour, who says that Auckland Council's plan will bring \"significant change to the character of New Zealand's oldest suburb\", or Chris Bishop, who's called criticism of the plan \"frankly nuts\"?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: I also heard Chris Bishop say that a local MP should advocate for the interests of their constituents. And it is certainly true that the plan will change the character of the city. That is absolutely true. So, I guess, once again, despite this member's attempts to divide us, we're both right.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: So is the Government's position that there is therefore housing intensification and more deregulation around building more houses, except in Epsom?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: Well, that's not true at all. For example, the Epsom electorate contains the Mt Eden train station where I expect and support there will be a lot more people living to take advantage of that upgrade in infrastructure. On the other hand, there are parts of the Epsom electorate, indeed parts of Auckland and every city, which have very old infrastructure that is crumbling, in some cases leaking sewage into the sea, and it would be foolhardy to intensify in those areas. That's one reason why this Government has reversed the previous Government's policy of allowing three-storey houses on any section, including floodplains—because the previous Government did some dumb stuff, but that was among the stupidest.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Is his Government committed to meeting New Zealand's emissions targets under the Paris Agreement?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: Yes, we are. But this Government, also, is a conscientious and collegial coalition of three parties who actually have a mind of their own. And on that topic, I just wonder when the Leader of the Opposition will tell the world what he thinks about someone saying that Black, Asian, and Indian New Zealanders should not participate in our democracy.SPEAKER: It's—[Interruption] I'm sure most people will make the judgment that you might just have.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Point of order, Mr Speaker. How is the Acting Prime Minister reflecting on my character and making a misrepresentation about something that I have or haven't said in any way relevant to the question or acceptable within the House?SPEAKER: Well, now that you raise it, that's not acceptable, but it is in the nature of debate. I don't think it would be fair to require it to be withdrawn or other such in the circumstances, because if you think about the nature of the questioning, it was along those lines—Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Point of order, Mr Speaker.SPEAKER: No, hang on a minute, I'm still speaking. You were, in your question, questioning the integrity and veracity of statements made by the Hon David Seymour compared to anybody else. It's not unreasonable that there is a comparison put back. Speakers' Rulings has a number of comments in it: if a political question is asked, expect a political answer. I think that's not unreasonable.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Point of order, Mr Speaker. What in particular did you find political about a question that said, \"Is his Government committed to meeting New Zealand's emissions targets under the Paris Agreement?\"—because that was the question.SPEAKER: No, that is quite right. The point I'm making is that, in the nature of the whole exchange, there was a high degree of political contention. Look, Speaker's ruling 187/1.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: Further point of order, Mr Speaker. No matter how political a debate, a member is not entitled to misrepresent the words of another member.SPEAKER: Well, from my memory, what he said is he invited a comment or a reflection on those, which he shouldn't have done. But it might help if the Acting Prime Minister, or the Prime Minister in this case, withdrew the comment.Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: Point of order, Mr Speaker. My answer simply held up a mirror to the Leader of the Opposition's questions. If he doesn't like what he sees, then perhaps he should change the questions.SPEAKER: No, no; that's your opinion.Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: For the sake of this country being able to get on with question time, I withdraw the comment.SPEAKER: Thank you.\n\nQuestion No. 3—Prime Minister3. Dr PARMJEET PARMAR (ACT) to the Acting Prime Minister: Does he stand by all of the Government's statements and actions?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR (Acting Prime Minister): Yes, absolutely and enthusiastically, particularly those actions that this Government is taking to cut wasteful spending, to cut red tape, and to enable New Zealanders to build their lives, their families, their firms, and their farms in this country so that we can all live a more prosperous life and overcome those challenges that we face.Dr Parmjeet Parmar: What changes are being made to resource management law?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: This country is a beautiful place and, in my view, the best in the world to live, but we have made it too hard for too long to build a place to live. That's why this Government is replacing the resource management laws with laws that don't say a council and anyone else that they ask has the right to say no all the time, that says that New Zealanders have the right to develop their property as they please, so long as they don't harm the enjoyment of others' property. That is a wonderful principle, it is a step-change in land use development, and it will allow the next generation to be able to build their futures, just as their grandparents were able to do, and give each of us, of any background, a brighter future in New Zealand.Dr Parmjeet Parmar: How will the Government's changes to our health and safety laws help small businesses?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: This country was built on a number eight wire, can-do, Sir Edmund Hillary, Kiwi attitude, and yet too often we find ourselves fearful of the very Government that we pay to enforce the laws. That's why I'm very proud to have this Government amending the approach to health and safety away from having lots of fear and not enough safety—retooling WorkSafe in such a way that it is there to guide and help people actually achieve safety as much as it is there to punish people. Brooke van Velden is to be commended for going out and listening and making substantial changes that make people's lives better. Dr Parmjeet Parmar: How is the Government making it easier for overseas investors to invest in New Zealand businesses and help them grow?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: This country has a long history of welcoming our friends around the world to share their money and their ideas, investing together in New Zealand's future. However, for too long we made it too hard for those people to come and join in New Zealand's economic success. It's not because they didn't want to; it's because we tied them up in too much bureaucracy and red tape. I'm proud that we have halved the time for overseas investment consents under this Government, and I'm proud that legislative changes before the House at the moment will see even greater improvements in the time taken for people to get consent to bring their money and their ideas in.Dr Parmjeet Parmar: Why is the Government simplifying our anti - money-laundering legislation?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: This is another example where in the rush to satisfy obligations imposed by overseas powers, we have hamstrung New Zealanders with red tape on things as simple as trying to open a bank account for a child. This Government is simplifying anti - money-laundering laws so that people can spend more time doing things that are productive, providing for themselves and their families, and less time tied up in red tape.Dr Parmjeet Parmar: How is the Government's Regulatory Standards Bill going to help raise the standard of lawmaking in New Zealand?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: For a long time, Governments have made various attempts at improving the quality of regulation and ensuring that there is a voice for the regulated, that people's property is respected, and that laws are made for the public interest rather than for short-term political advantage by certain politicians. The Regulatory Standards Bill will ensure that people's rights are set out clearly in law so that the public are better able to judge the quality of the laws being made, and that is a welcome maturation in our constitutional settings in New Zealand.\n\nQuestion No. 4—Transport4. DAN BIDOIS (National—Northcote) to the Minister of Transport: What announcements has he made regarding Auckland transport governance?Hon CHRIS BISHOP (Minister of Transport): Last week, the Government announced—the Minister of Auckland, Hon Simeon Brown, and His Worship Wayne Brown—we'll be delivering on our promise to restore local democracy to Auckland. Responsibility for most transport functions in Auckland will shift from Auckland Transport to Auckland Council, including all policy and planning work. The council will become the road controlling authority and deliver transport capital projects while maintaining transport infrastructure. This is the case in every other council around the country, apart from in Auckland, and we are now bringing Auckland into line with every other council.Dan Bidois: How does this change restore local democracy in Auckland?Hon CHRIS BISHOP: Local democracy in Auckland is very important. Right now, Aucklanders raise their transport concerns with local councillors, local board members, or even the mayor. That's instinctively who New Zealanders think are responsible for their local roads, but the levers Auckland Council has to effect change are very little. Auckland Council does not have direct control over its transport system currently, nor is it a road controlling authority. We are making Auckland Council directly responsible for local roads again so that when Aucklanders raise concerns with their elected local representatives, they actually have levers to do something about it.Dan Bidois: What about future planning for Auckland's transport system?Hon CHRIS BISHOP: The changes will establish an Auckland regional transport committee, comprising an equal share of Auckland Council members and ministerial appointees alongside an independent chair. It will prepare a 30-year transport plan for Auckland, building on the previous Auckland Transport alignment project from the last National Government, to steer investment and shape the future of transport in Auckland. It's critical to get central and local government aligned, and I'm really confident this plan will do just that.Dan Bidois: What reaction has he seen to this announcement?Hon CHRIS BISHOP: There has been widespread support from many Aucklanders. I quote proud Aucklander Simeon Brown: \"For too long, Auckland Transport has not listened to Aucklanders.\" I want to thank Mayor Brown and Simeon Brown for their hard work on these campaigns. Aucklanders don't have to wait too long for these changes to be made. The bill will have its first reading this month and it's meant to pass into law next year, so we can get on with restoring local democracy to Auckland.\n\nQuestion No. 5—Finance5. Hon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana) to the Minister of Finance: Does she stand by all her statements and actions in relation to the resignations of the former Reserve Bank Chair and Governor?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Mr Speaker, yes.Hon Barbara Edmonds: When did she first become aware of the reasons for Adrian Orr's resignation?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: That was on the Thursday night when I read the Ombudsman's ruling—which, as I check my timing, was 27 August—which outlined the specific concerns which were in the letter of concerns shared by the Reserve Bank, a letter I have not seen and had not seen previously, and which also detailed events preceding the receipt of that letter.Hon Barbara Edmonds: Was she aware that a letter of concern had been sent before 28 August?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: On 27 February, I received a text message from the Secretary to the Treasury informing me that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand board had agreed to start an employment process in respect of the governor of the Reserve Bank. Later that night, in a separate text message, I was informed that the governor had elected to go on leave until the end of the process, and that he had been given until the close of business Monday to respond to a board statement of concern on his conduct.Hon Barbara Edmonds: Why was the contents of that text on 27 February withheld under the Official Information Act (OIA)?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: I have asked that very question today of my own team, who, through Treasury, I think have upheld high standards over the OIA throughout this exchange. They inform me that it was withheld under section 9(ba)(i), which is to protect information which is subject to an obligation of confidence likely to prejudice the supply of information of that sort in future. I have judged that it is in the public interest for me to share the contents of that text message with Parliament today.Hon Barbara Edmonds: Is she aware that the contents of that text was withheld in an earlier OIA request, and why is it that just today she is releasing to the public the contents of that text, given her responsibility under the Reserve Bank Act?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: Well, because I am satisfied that the grounds for withholding under the Official Information Act were valid. I also think that it is now correct, given the official information that has been released by the Reserve Bank, that I provide this information to Parliament.SPEAKER: I just suggest that this is not a matter for some of the cross-House banter that's going on while answers are being given.Rt Hon Winston Peters: Can I ask the Minister, has she heard the song, \"Who wants yesterday's paper? Who wants yesterday's news?\" and is she getting on with the future management of the Reserve Bank?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: A very good question, indeed, and I look forward to welcoming a new Governor of the Reserve Bank very soon.Hon Barbara Edmonds: Was her office or herself consulted on in relation to the OIA, under which the text of 27 February was withheld?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: I would have to check to give you the most accurate answer, but it is normal that, when Treasury, receives an Official Information Act request, my office is informed about their intended response to it. I think, in this case, Treasury was making a judgment based on two things: one, the fact that the text specifically referred to an employment process that had been commenced that, at that point, had not been released by the employer in question, and so therefore sharing that information when the employer subject to the exit agreement had chosen not to share it would have actually triggered the concern in the Official Information Act—[Interruption] It is very hard to even hear myself think with all of that barracking, Mr Speaker. It is, therefore, in terms of the Official Information Act, correct that it could have prejudiced the receipt of that sort of information in future, as I've said in this House clearly. It is my view now, in light of the timeline of events that the Ombudsman has released, which makes clear that that letter of concern had been released, that it is in the public interest for me to share that I was informed of that employment process having begun on 27 February.Hon Barbara Edmonds: Is she confirming that neither she nor her office was consulted in relation to the information and contents of a text that was withheld under the Official Information Act (OIA)?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: I'm confirming no such thing.Hon Barbara Edmonds: Is she confident that her handling of information requests relating to the exit of the former governor did meet her expectations of transparency and of public accountability?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: Yes.Hon Barbara Edmonds: Why should New Zealanders have confidence in her when she has only just advised the House and the public of the contents of a text on 27 February, and how is it not usual that either she or her office have not reviewed the OIA before it was released?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: Because these are matters relating to an employment process. If Minister's choose to engage themselves in employment processes characterising them when they have not been a party to those processes, they risk politicising those processes in ways that can threaten the reputation of important institutions.Rt Hon Winston Peters: Regardless of this boring dialogue, how will the new Reserve Bank Governor go if there is no inflation cap set for the governor?Hon Kieran McAnulty: Just for absolute clarity in the House, it's now OK to provide that sort of commentary before asking a question?SPEAKER: It's an observation, and it is not something that should be done. Questions should be simple, start with a question word, and carry on, and I've made that point before.Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: They also have to relate to the primary.SPEAKER: Well, if you look at the primary, it talks in relation to—Rt Hon Chris Hipkins: The resignation.SPEAKER: —statements and actions in relation to the resignation of the former—but, look, as we know, questions move on. [Interruption] Wait on, wait on. I think, in this case, we will simply move on. The point has been made.\n\nQuestion No. 6—Finance6. CHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green) to the Minister of Finance: Does she stand by all the Government's statements and actions on economic and fiscal policy?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Yes, and I particularly stand by our commitment to an inflation target of 1 to 3 percent with a midpoint of 2. Unlike some members of this House, I won't be advocating for faster price increases across the economy, which would only add to the cost of living.Chlöe Swarbrick: Does she stand by her statement that \"investing in smart, targeted … interventions … not only make a difference in the lives of … whānau, but mean the Government reduces the money it might otherwise [spend] on treating the symptoms rather than the cause of dysfunction\", and, if she does, does she consider ensuring that our most vulnerable New Zealanders have somewhere safe to sleep at night a \"smart, targeted early intervention\"?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: In answer to the first part of the question: yes.Chlöe Swarbrick: What does she consider to be \"treating the symptoms rather than the cause of dysfunction\" if not her Government's decision to cancel thousands of new public homes and now pump taxpayer money into the private rental market for just 300 temporary homes?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: Well, a very good example of treating the symptoms and not the cause of a problem would be the Government continuing to provide ever-larger subsidies for State-sponsored housing while failing to deal with the underlying driver of ridiculous house price increases in New Zealand, which is planning law that has been weaponised against progress and development, weaponised against new housing subdivisions, weaponised against housing intensification. This Government is getting to the root cause of New Zealand's housing unaffordability problems by getting rid of the Resource Management Act (RMA) and saying yes to more houses.Chlöe Swarbrick: Does she accept that investment in public housing reduces crime; saves money in health; and improves educational, employment, and broader economic outcomes, and, if so, why has the Government decided to cancel building thousands of new State homes and slash emergency housing access, generating greater homelessness across the country?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: Well, yes, I agree that publicly funded housing can deliver a range of positive social outcomes. But it's also the case that we need to ensure that public housing is delivered efficiently, that it is the right kind of houses that are of the right typographies created in a value-for-money way. It's also the case that under the last Government, the number of people on the State house waiting list multiplied even while they said that they were dealing with State housing challenges.Rt Hon Winston Peters: Could I ask the Minister on this question of the house rental costs: has it gone up in the last 12 months or has it come down?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: Well, I understand that, in fact, rent increases are the lowest they've been in some years. In fact, according to a measure I read yesterday, rents have actually declined, which I would have thought the member for Auckland Central—who used to claim she stood for renters—would be welcoming and even celebrating.Chlöe Swarbrick: What is the economic cost of the increased homelessness that has resulted from Government decisions which it was warned would happen if it went ahead with those very decisions?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: Well, there are a lot of assertions in that question, but what is absolutely the case—and which the numbers prove—is that while that member was a supporting member of this Parliament of the previous Government, it is the case that thousands of children were being raised in motel rooms that I can guarantee didn't meet your healthy homes standards. You stood by, you tolerated it. We've fixed it. [Interruption]Hon Chris Bishop: Supplementary question.SPEAKER: Hold on. We're going to wait while everybody calms down.Hon Chris Bishop: Can the Minister confirm that 50 percent of people on the social housing register need a one-bedroom unit but Kāinga Ora only has 12 percent of its stock being one bedroom, and of the 1,500 houses funded in Budget 2024 that have been allocated so far, 89 percent of those houses are for one- and two-bedroom units?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: Yes. What this underscores is the importance of ensuring we don't just build houses, but that we build the right houses that respond to the needs we see in our community. I'm also happy to confirm that the creation of the community housing fund means that this Government has deliberately decreased the cost of borrowing for those community organisations wishing to build more public housing.Chlöe Swarbrick: Will the finance Minister then take up the invitation—which the Prime Minister has so far ignored—to walk the streets of Auckland Central to meet the people, including the children, who her Government's decisions have made homeless?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: Well, I think the more immediate response, if the member is aware of any children living on the street, would be for her to urgently bring that information to the Ministry of Social Development to ensure those children get the support to which they are entitled.Rt Hon Winston Peters: If the Prime Minister does take up the invitation, could she possibly warn the Prime Minister that if he does, he'll have to face all those orange cones that the Green Party and others have put on the main street of central Auckland—in her electorate?SPEAKER: No, that's not a question for the Minister of Finance.\n\nQuestion No. 7—Health7. Dr VANESSA WEENINK (National—Banks Peninsula) to the Minister of Health: What recent announcements has he made about improved access to elective procedures for patients?Hon SIMEON BROWN (Minister of Health): Good news: the Government has exceeded its first Elective Boost target, delivering 16,005 additional procedures by 30 June—that is 50.3 percent more than planned, meaning thousands more New Zealanders have received life-changing surgery, such as hip and knee replacements and cataract operations, sooner. Our initiative has reduced pressure on wait-lists and, most importantly, helped Kiwis get the care they need when they need it. Dr Vanessa Weenink: What impact has the Elective Boost had on wait-lists?Hon SIMEON BROWN: Well, since the boost began, the total elective treatment wait-list has dropped by 9 percent, and the number of people waiting more than four months has fallen by 22 percent. These improvements have been felt across the country, with 4,766 procedures being carried out in the Northern region, 5,051 in the Midland, 2,961 in Central, and 3,227 procedures in the South Island. We acknowledge that too many New Zealanders have been waiting too long for the care that they need, and that's why we're continuing to put patients first and deliver for them.Dr Vanessa Weenink: Who has benefited from the Elective Boost so far?Hon SIMEON BROWN: Kiwis from all walks of life have benefited from our Elective Boost. We've seen 638 hip surgeries, 751 knee surgeries, and 5,058 cataract surgeries carried out. Behind each one of those numbers is a New Zealander whose quality of life has been improved—whether it's a tradie who can get back to work, a nana being able to see her grandchildren clearly again, or a child finally getting their tonsils removed. This Government is focused on patients and delivering the outcomes that New Zealanders expect.Dr Vanessa Weenink: What is the next step in the Government's plan to improve access to elective procedures?Hon SIMEON BROWN: Well, this is just the beginning, and the next phase is already under way, with the target of an additional 21,000 elective procedures over the coming year. We're making the health system work smarter, using both public hospitals and private providers in a coordinated national effort. New Zealanders don't care who is delivering the service; they just want it done, and they want it done quickly. That is the approach this Government is taking, and it's delivering results.\n\nQuestion No. 8—Health8. Hon Dr AYESHA VERRALL (Labour) to the Minister of Health: Does he stand by his statement, \"we want to get value for money for the taxpayer\" for surgeries outsourced to private hospitals; if so, how is Health New Zealand achieving value for money?Hon SIMEON BROWN (Minister of Health): To the first part of that question, in the context it was made, yes. As I've said before, working with private providers means we can deliver more hip operations, knee replacements, and cataract surgeries, helping to reduce wait-lists. I'm advised that Health New Zealand operated a competitive request for proposal (RFP) process across the private hospitals for planned care treatment in 2024. It is now preparing to renew the panel agreements from 2026 with nationally standardised terms and conditions while maintaining a competitive market. This process has given Health New Zealand insights and prices from all providers for a wide range of procedures. Health New Zealand used this information and its own internal costings to negotiate the optimal price for each location and each treatment. As a result of the boost, the total wait-list has fallen by 9 percent and the number of people waiting more than four months has dropped by 22 percent—a great result for patients.Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Will he release the price Health New Zealand pays for outsourcing surgeries to private providers?Hon SIMEON BROWN: Well, as I announced back in March, Health New Zealand had allocated approximately $50 million as part of the elective boost to deliver an extra 10,500 procedures by the middle of the year, and, of course, they delivered more than that, which is great news for patients.Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Point of order, Mr Speaker. The question was about the price paid for the procedures, not the cost to Health New Zealand. The price wasn't even addressed.SPEAKER: Well, I think it was, when he said that the allocation was $50 million and they got more for it than they did.Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Speaking to the point of order, that is the amount Health New Zealand spends, but the price—for example, that a hip operation cost $20,000—wasn't addressed at all.SPEAKER: OK, I'm sitting here thinking, \"Should I ask the Minister to say more?\", but, I'm sorry, in my head, when I heard $50 million was spent and they got more for it than they expected, they're probably in the right space, but if the Minister wants to make a comment, that's his prerogative.Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Why, when ACC releases the price per procedure that they pay for surgeries, won't Health New Zealand release that information for private surgeries?Hon SIMEON BROWN: Well, as I said in my primary answer, they have gone through a competitive RFP process to ensure that they can negotiate the prices. I'm advised that Health New Zealand at this time is going through further procurement processes with nationally consistent terms, and it is important that they are able to maintain a competitive market. Ultimately, we've allocated funds, and our focus is on making sure that we deliver outcomes for patients and get those treatments done sooner. It's exactly what the previous Minister of Health, the Rt Hon Chris Hipkins, said in a Cabinet paper in 2020, where he said, \"I expect DHBs and their local private hospital(s) to reach appropriate contractual arrangements that allow for services to be increased to address backlogs.\" That's exactly what we're doing.Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall: Why, when the Government is, in his own words, paying significant premiums for outsourced surgeries, won't he release the price of those surgeries?Hon SIMEON BROWN: Well, Health New Zealand is working through a contractual process to ensure value for money. That is the right thing for them to do. Ultimately, this is about delivering additional services—Hon Damien O'Connor: Money for your mates.Hon SIMEON BROWN: —for New Zealanders so they spend less time waiting on wait-lists. We've been very clear that $50 million was allocated; more surgeries were delivered. The final cost of the elective boost in the first half of this year will—ultimately, the costings of that will be confirmed as part of the end-of-year financial accounts. The fact that over 50 percent more surgeries were delivered means that the cost was probably likely to be higher than the $50 million allocated, but, ultimately, this is about patients getting the services they need in a more timely manner.Hon David Seymour: Point of order. During that answer, a Labour member said, \"Money for your mates.\" in reference to the Government's procurement process. That member happens to be a real stickler for the rules; I wonder if he'd like to withdraw it.SPEAKER: Well, whoever said it needs to just rein themselves in a bit. That is not an acceptable thing.Hon Damien O'Connor: Point of order, Mr Speaker. Thank you, Mr Speaker. I said that, but I'm not a sticker for the rules, so I'm not quite sure who the member was referring to.SPEAKER: Yep, well, only a West Coaster could come up with that, so you get a bit of leeway.\n\nQuestion No. 9—Trade and Investment9. RIMA NAKHLE (National—Takanini) to the Minister for Trade and Investment: What recent progress has the Government made in unlocking new opportunities for New Zealand exporters in the United Arab Emirates?Hon TODD McCLAY (Minister for Trade and Investment): On 28 August, the New Zealand - United Arab Emirates Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement officially entered into force, just seven months after signature. It's New Zealand's fastest ever negotiated agreement—negotiated in just on four months—and is one of New Zealand's highest-quality agreements on entry into force. It's part of the Government's plan to back Kiwi exporters, create more jobs, and to increase wages.Rima Nakhle: What specific market access improvements does the United Arab Emirates deal deliver for New Zealand exporters, especially for the primary sector?Hon TODD McCLAY: Well, the UAE is a key hub in the Gulf region, with two-way trade valued at just under $1.5 billion annually; and 98.5 percent of New Zealand's exports to the UAE will now enter duty free, rising to 99 percent within three years. Key goods including dairy, red meat, apples, kiwifruit, seafood, forestry products, and honey—they're all duty free now. The agreement also includes significant commitments to support New Zealand's professional services, including the education, gaming, film, and engineering industries.Rima Nakhle: How will the United Arab Emirates deal improve New Zealand's global competitiveness?Hon TODD McCLAY: Well, New Zealand's a trading nation and we don't get rich only selling to ourselves, so the agreement positions New Zealand to compete with the best in the world. It secures preferential access for New Zealand exporters across competitive sectors vital to our economy and in areas that our exporters have had to compete against others in the UAE. It also strengthens supply chains with a vital trading partner and introduces provisions on sustainable development, intellectual property, and labour that reflect New Zealand's high standards. This is a trade deal that delivers for hard-working New Zealanders and means our exporters can do better in a market that will return more money to the pockets of Kiwis.Rima Nakhle: How does this United Arab Emirates deal align with the Government's trade and investment strategy?Hon TODD McCLAY: Well, the UAE trade deal's an important step in our strategy to reduce trade barriers and offer new opportunities to New Zealand exporters. The deal unlocks a US$500 billion economy that's growing and diversifying rapidly. The UAE imports 90 percent of its food, creating strong new opportunities for New Zealand's world-class food producers and, of course, therefore our farmers. With this agreement and the conclusion of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) deal last October, the Government is focused on growing the economy; unlocking key markets; increasing export returns; and, again, creating higher-paying jobs for New Zealanders.\n\nQuestion No. 10—Prime Minister10. DEBBIE NGAREWA-PACKER (Co-Leader—Te Pāti Māori) to the Acting Prime Minister: Does he stand by all his Government's statements and actions?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR (Acting Prime Minister): Yes, absolutely. I'd particularly like to reference this Government's reintroduction of charter schools, kura hourua: in the Far North, Te Rito; in South Auckland, TIPENE; and now in Kaikohe, potentially, Northland College—schools where communities are adopting the charter school, kura hourua model. They are enabling students from all background, but in many cases Māori students, to be empowered to navigate the 21st century with the skills and education that all of us require to do that. I note that, in the past, the member's party has been a staunch supporter of the charter school concept, and I hope that she will reaffirm it.Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Will the Prime Minister call for the safe passage of the Global Sumud Flotilla, a fleet of boats carrying delegations from all around the world, including New Zealanders, delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: We are focused on the wellbeing of people in New Zealand primarily. There is a huge amount of suffering, of people right here in this country, that we are focused on alleviating. I find it strange that a party is so focused on a symbolic statement that it would like to see the Government make. I would have thought their priorities would be a little closer to home.Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Point of order. New Zealand has a UN membership duty to protect its own citizens abroad. That squarely sits within this Government's responsibility. That question should be asked and answered squarely for all New Zealanders who want to know what you're doing to protect New Zealanders that are on the flotilla.SPEAKER: Well, that might be the response that the member wants, but the question was answered when the Acting Prime Minister said that primarily the focus is on people suffering in this country.Rt Hon Winston Peters: Point of order. With respect, the question is bordering on the requisite to rule it out, because we have put out official statements, in the interests of New Zealanders' safety, against entry to Gaza, the possible human damage that will result from it, and on joining flotillas, for the same purpose. This Government has put out numerous statements for people not to do that, and you've got somebody here today in question time demanding that we do just that.SPEAKER: Well, the question was, with all due respect, about what is being done, and perhaps that was an answer the Acting Prime Minister might have given, but I think the intervention is most useful in that regard. Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, please contain your question—just ask your question.Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Does he accept that failing to demand safe humanitarian corridors puts New Zealanders delivering aid at risk?SPEAKER: Sorry, can I hear that question again?Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Does he accept that failing to demand safe humanitarian corridors puts New Zealanders delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza at risk?SPEAKER: Look, I don't know that the Prime Minister could have responsibility for that. With all due respect, there is no answer available for that.Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Does the Prime Minister believe that the Government has an obligation to protect New Zealand citizens abroad?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: Yes, the New Zealand Government does its best to protect New Zealand citizens abroad, but often the way that the New Zealand Government does that is by warning them not to go to dangerous places, and the reason for that is that the New Zealand Government does not have the power to influence the safety of every person on the planet, agile and effective though the New Zealand Defence Force may be. But there is something in this line of questioning where the member really believes that the New Zealand Government making a demand will make people on the other side of the world safe. Now, when we live in a country where a child is killed, on average, every five weeks, I would have thought it would be time to return to the real and the practical, rather than the symbolic and the theatrical.Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Does he accept the findings of the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and the International Criminal Court that the famine in Gaza City affecting over 500,000 people is man-made?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: Well, those organisations might very well make those claims, but the fact is that the New Zealand Government takes practical actions where it believes it can have an effect. That includes devoting, if my memory serves me, $37 million of taxpayer money in aid to that part of the world. That includes sanctioning two Israeli Ministers that we believe have said things that they certainly should not have said. That includes criticising and calling for the immediate release of all hostages by Hamas. If the member believes the most important thing we can do is talk about whether an organisation's statement is correct or not, I don't think she is living in the real world.Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Has the Government sought assurances from Israel that humanitarian workers will be protected?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: This is an area which is at war, and we do well to remember that it is at war because a terrorist group invaded a peaceful country, kidnapped, raped, and kept hostages and continues to use those hostages as bargaining chips. I would have thought a bit of awareness would leave the member well ahead of where she is right now in her understanding.Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Point of order. [Interruption]SPEAKER: Points of order are heard in silence.Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: My question is not about Hamas. It is about New Zealanders delivering humanitarian aid and the community accepting that the famine is man-made. My supplementary, please, for the Speaker.SPEAKER: Yes, and the question was most—Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Is the Prime Minister—SPEAKER: Sorry, sorry—where are you at? You just took a point of order, and you hadn't asked me to respond to it. Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Sorry, if you want to, that's great. Apologies.SPEAKER: The question was addressed. Ask another supplementary.Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Is the Prime Minister stating that they dispute the findings of the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)?Hon DAVID SEYMOUR: What I'm saying is that the Government does not have responsibility for—as the member said just a second ago—what the community thinks. Now, there are some societies where the Government does take responsibility for what the community thinks, but I don't want to live in one of those societies.\n\nQuestion No. 11—Economic Growth11. Hon GINNY ANDERSEN (Labour) to the Minister for Economic Growth: Does she agree with the statement of the Minister of Finance that \"cost of living relief is on its way\"; if so, why?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister for Economic Growth): Yes. As Minister of Finance, I made that statement last year when announcing tax relief that benefitted millions of New Zealand households. Changes to income tax thresholds, the in-work tax credit, and other measures made around 1.9 million New Zealand households better off, on average, by $60 a fortnight. Households with children were even better off, on average, by $78 a fortnight. All superannuitants were better off, and members opposite voted against it. Hon Ginny Andersen: Why is administrative inflation the highest it's been since 1990?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: The largest driver of that is rates increases, which is why, on this side of the House, we have the courage to investigate caps on rates rises, which her leader seems to think would be a terrible thing.Hon Ginny Andersen: Why should families carry the burden of higher costs, such as public transport and vehicle registrations, when those pressures stem directly from her Government's decision to cut spending and raise fees?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: I am very concerned by price increases in the economy, which is why, under this Government, we're targeting inflation between 1 to 3 percent with a mid-band of 2 percent. I understand that the approach of that member and her party is to advocate for higher price increases across the economy with an inflation mid-point of 2.5 percent, which would mean higher prices for everything. Hon Ginny Andersen: Is the reason that 60 percent of New Zealanders still rank the cost as living as their number one concern due to her Government continually hiking up fees that Kiwis are forced to pay?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: No. Hon Ginny Andersen: Is the reason that Kiwis are losing faith with National's ability to manage the economy due to her empty promises that relief is on its way, while she continues to hike fees that just make the cost of living even worse?Hon NICOLA WILLIS: No, if we're going to talk about empty promises, let's talk about crocodile tears. If that member really cared about the cost of living and providing income relief to New Zealand households, she would have voted for tax relief, and she would vote for the increases in the FamilyBoost rebate that this party will soon bring to the House.\n\nQuestion No. 12—Foreign Affairs12. Hon MARAMA DAVIDSON (Co-Leader—Green) to the Minister of Foreign Affairs: Does he stand by all of the Government's statements and actions on foreign policy? Rt Hon WINSTON PETERS (Minister of Foreign Affairs): Yes, as articulated and undertaken by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, as written by his staff this afternoon, and endorsed by all of Foreign Affairs here and in the many far-flung posts abroad. Hon Marama Davidson: Does he stand by his statement of 29 days ago that \"The Government will carefully weigh up its position over the next month on recognition of a state of Palestine.\", and, if so, what decision, if any, has the Government come to? Rt Hon WINSTON PETERS: To the first part of that question, of course I stand by that decision, and to the second part, when the decision is made, I'll tell that member what it is. Hon Marama Davidson: Why is his Government still making up its mind on recognising statehood while France, Canada, the UK, Australia, Norway, and Spain have all opted to do so? Rt Hon WINSTON PETERS: Well, with the greatest of respect, if you want to look at democracies, which one of those countries can tell us what a democracy should look like, given our proud record going all the way back to 1854, and giving Māori the vote in 1867 and women the vote first, before all the other countries. Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Oh, lucky Māoris! You \"gave\" us—you \"gave\" us. Rt Hon WINSTON PETERS: No, no, no, no—not half-Māori; I mean real ones. Not the Irish Packers—not Irish Packers. Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Point of order, Mr Speaker. SPEAKER: Point of order, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer—to be heard in silence. Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: I take offence to what the previous speaker has just said. It is not appropriate to use this place to blood-quantum, and to sit there and suggest that someone—Hon Members: Oh!Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: —is part something. SPEAKER: Just a moment. Now, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer is going to repeat her point of order, and there will be no response along those lines. Anyone who does will of course be leaving the House. Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Mr Speaker, thank you. I take exception to the language that was used by the previous speaker suggesting blood quantum and that Māori should be considered \"part\". That is unparliamentary language. SPEAKER: Well, it certainly is, and I'd invite the member to withdraw that comment and continue his—Rt Hon WINSTON PETERS: No, no. Point of order, Mr Speaker. When I got to the point about the quality of New Zealand's democracy, first in 1854 and then Māori getting the vote in 1867, that's when they started shouting about blood quantum and everything else. It's they that made the offence, sir, and I was reacting to it. They just can't take the heat. SPEAKER: I must confess that there was an awful lot of noise. I didn't hear the full exchange. I will look at the Hansard and come back to the House. Hon Kieran McAnulty: Point of order, Mr Speaker. SPEAKER: Sorry? Hon Kieran McAnulty: Point of order, sir. SPEAKER: Look, I've just told you that I'm coming back to the House when I've looked at the Hansard, so there's no other bits to it. Hon Kieran McAnulty: Well, I'm not disputing that, sir—SPEAKER: Good. Hon Kieran McAnulty: —but you've asked a member to withdraw, and he did not. SPEAKER: That's right, and I've said that I would now look at the Hansard because I never heard the comment and the member has disputed that it was objectionable. Debbie Ngarewa-Packer: Point of order, Mr Speaker. You can check the Hansard, but I can guarantee that I did not say that, and it was me that placed the point of order. SPEAKER: Well, that is trifling with the Chair, which is not an advisable thing. Hon Marama Davidson: Is he comfortable with allowing New Zealand to become part of just 20 percent of nations who still have no commitment to recognising Palestinian statehood? Rt Hon WINSTON PETERS: The reality is that the circumstances are dramatically changing. We're going off to the United Nations, and, hopefully, by then we will know all the facts. If this was a financial decision, that's the least we would do, and this is a critical decision, as well. We've said from the very beginning that it's not a question of \"if\"; it's \"when\", but it's the quality of the recognition, or the standards we have set, that we do not seek to let ourselves down on. This is not against anyone at all, and might I just say this: we have spent considerable time talking to scores and scores of countries in the Middle East and elsewhere who understand our position and respect it. Who has she talked to? Hon Marama Davidson: Is he concerned that every day the international community delays recognition of Palestinian statehood, a two-State solution becomes further out of reach, as Israel continues building illegal settlements without consequence? Hon Shane Jones: Speculation. Rt Hon WINSTON PETERS: This is the kind of illogical thinking that should be—Chlöe Swarbrick: We voted on the motion, Shane, in September. SPEAKER: No, no, hang on—sorry. Don't ask a question—Rt Hon WINSTON PETERS: But I can handle it—don't worry. SPEAKER: I'm not talking to you. I'm just saying to these people over here on the other side of the House: don't ask a question of that nature, which is barely permissible under the Standing Orders, and then start barracking over the top of it when an answer starts. Rt Hon WINSTON PETERS: This the kind of illogical thinking that we'd hope would be expunged from somebody before they even got to Parliament. To come here and make that statement when there's not a shred of evidence to back it up is, I think, a disappointment for this Parliament and, dare I say, for the Green Party. Hon Marama Davidson: Does he agree with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade that \"As a small country which depends on the international rules-based system for both security and prosperity, it is fundamental to New Zealand interests that these rules are supported and that serious violations are sanctioned.\", and, if so, why has the Government not sanctioned Israel for their serious violations of international law in Palestine? Rt Hon WINSTON PETERS: For the umpteenth time, we have condemned on countless occasions more than any other circumstance we've been involved in in recent politics what has gone on there, and we have sanctioned Israelis, and we have sanctioned members of Parliament, as well. This has all been stated to this country. What would we do now? This idea that, somehow, whatever New Zealand does is going to stop the strife and solve the situation is, I think, extraordinarily naïve. But here's the point: we're going to the United Nations, and we'll have the benefit of every country's view at that point in time, and then we can make a seriously considered decision then. SPEAKER: That concludes oral questions.\n\nPoint of Order—Withdrawal of Statements by MinistersHon KIERAN McANULTY (Labour): Point of order, Mr Speaker. Thank you very much, sir. On two occasions today during question time, you asked a Minister to withdraw a statement. On the first occasion, there was commentary provided by the Minister before the withdrawal was made, and on the second occasion there was no withdrawal made. Now, a former member for the seat of Ilam, when shadow Leader of the House, if asked to withdraw and apologise would do so and then make a point of order, which is the proper process, and given your commitment to review what has occurred during the last question, I wonder whether you would also agree to review whether the request to withdraw comments today was followed as it should be. My concern is if that is the approach that is allowed moving forward, it is yet another step towards disorder in the House. SPEAKER: Well, I thank you for pointing out the considerable wisdom of the former member for the Ilam seat. Certainly, a volume of information from that member is going to be considered in any decisions I make, and I'll come back to the member tomorrow with an answer on that. I declare the House in committee for consideration of the Appropriation (2025/26 Estimates) Bill.\n\nESTIMATES DEBATEIn CommitteeCHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Members, the House is in committee for consideration of the Appropriation (2025/26 Estimates) Bill. The Business Committee has determined to organise the debate by portfolio, so there will be no sector-specific debates. All Votes are available for debate, but only specific Ministers will be available each day to speak to the indicated portfolio. The Government has indicated that the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, the Minister of Transport, the Minister of Housing, the Minister for the Environment, and the Minister for Vocational Education will be available today. Each debate will be led by a call from the chairperson or member of the committee that considers the Estimates most closely related to the Minister's portfolio. In leading off the debate, the chairperson should take care not to be overly political and should ensure their call gives a fair reflection of the committee's report on the Votes relevant to the portfolio. The debate expires after 11 hours, at which point questions will be put that the Vote stand part of the Schedules and on the provisions of the Appropriation (2025/26 Estimates) Bill. New Zealand National has four hours and 25 minutes. New Zealand Labour has three hours and four minutes. The Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand has one hour and 21 minutes. ACT New Zealand has 60 minutes. New Zealand First has 43 minutes. Te Pati Māori has 27 minutes. The Estimates debate should be relevant to the Government's current spending plans as contained in the Estimates of Appropriations. A compendium of the reports of select committees on the Votes is available on the Table. The question is that the Votes contained in the Estimates of Appropriations for 2025-26 stand part of the Schedules.Members, we start with the Minister of Finance. The Minister is available to speak to that portfolio from 3 o'clock to 4 o'clock. We may have to look, due to question time, whether that end timeframe is suitable, but I'll keep you informed. I now give the call to the chairperson of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, Cameron Brewer.\n\nCAMERON BREWER (National—Upper Harbour): Thank you, Madam Speaker. When the Government came to office, we immediately restored fiscal discipline but we also wanted to drive and direct New Zealand's economic recovery. Budget 2025 reinforced and highlighted this Government's priorities and approach. On Budget Day, the Finance Minister's announcement of Investment Boost got a quick and positive response out there in small-business New Zealand. Investment Boost lets businesses deduct 20 percent of the cost of a new asset off their taxable income—on top of depreciation—designed to have both an instant and sustainable hit. In fact, Treasury and Inland Revenue advised at the time that Investment Boost would contribute to GDP growth, wages, and capital stock over time.Secondly, significant KiwiSaver changes. Budget 2025 saw the default rate up, over time, from 3 to 4 percent. The Government contribution for those earning over $180,000 was taken away and the popular extension of contributions was entrenched for 16- and 17-year-olds. A third highlight, for me, was in education: the largest boost in a generation for learning support, meaning more teacher aid hours, learning support coordinators across years 1 and 8, and an overhaul of the Ongoing Resourcing Scheme funding system. Our higher needs kids will finally get the support they need.Budget 2025 backs investment, builds savings, and support where it matters most. My question is to the Minister of Finance and asks: what evidence, on the ground, has she seen that the Investment Boost is indeed making a difference to Kiwi businesses and the wider New Zealand economy?\n\nTANGI UTIKERE (Labour—Palmerston North): Point of order. Thank you, Madam Chair. I didn't want to interrupt the member. Thank you for your earlier comment about the time. I know that it would be helpful for members on this side of the Chamber to get an indication on whether the Minister was going to go through to the full hour or not.CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Ah, yes. Yes, I was just going to announce that as I called the Minister up to speaker. And we're looking at about 4.12 instead of 4 o'clock. Thank you.\n\nHon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): I'm pleased to share with the committee that I receive anecdotal feedback on the impact of Investment Boost on a weekly basis—most recently from the MP for Ōtaki, Tim Costley, who shared with me a text message from a small business owner in his community who had felt confident enough to replace their work vehicle as a result of the Investment Boost policy.I do want to make clear to the House that Investment Boost is not a short-term measure; it is a long-term initiative to get more investment for Kiwi businesses, which, of course, happens over many years, not just weeks or months. Right now, firms are facing uncertainty so some of them will have muted investment intentions, but that will change as the economy picks up. The Investment Boost policy is intended to encourage levels of capital investment, which will lead to greater future productivity and greater wage rises.I was also in Australia last week, where I spoke with a range of Australian businesses who were very interested indeed in New Zealand's Investment Boost policy. In the words of the Australian Financial Review, who reported on our policies, \"New Zealand's Minister for finance and economic growth … has stolen a march on Australia by offering a tax break for companies investing across the Tasman.\" That is just another confirmation that this is a very good policy indeed.\n\nHon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): Thank you, Madam Chair. Despite all the introductory comments by the chair of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, which I understood was meant to be non-political and actually a really good opportunity to go through the actual report, I do want to question the Minister to begin with around some of the responses that she had to that member, because, actually, we have a different view around Budget and the backdrop of Budget.Budget 2025 is that thousands of businesses have shut down, tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs, and people are skipping doctor's visits because they can't actually afford it. The Minister said that she has received a lot of anecdotal data around the support for Investment Boost, including from one further up the line, about 30 minutes away from here. I want to hear from the Minister whether she's actually received any data around the actual uptake of Investment Boost to date, and, if so, can the Minister please share that with the House?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): As previously communicated to that member, we have not received data, because it is very difficult for IRD to disaggregate what investment is a consequence of Investment Boost and what isn't. At the end of the year, of course, we will be able to see how many claims have been made for the Investment Boost policy. I just hope that the member's not changing her tune, because I'm looking at an article from 27 May, in which Barbara Edmonds says the Government's Investment Boost is \"good for business\".Hon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): Again, it's really great to hear my own words being repeated to me, because I actually know my own words. I also know a bit about tax. So the question I actually have for the Minister is: if she is unable to provide any data to date because it can't be disaggregated, what is the data to date that has not been disaggregated?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): No, it's simply that there isn't any data yet.CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger):  Just before the member asks the next question, the point of this exercise is for members to be able to ask questions to the Minister. There's a lot of shouting coming from the other side, making it difficult for everyone in the Chamber to be able to hear some of the questions.Hon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): Thank you, Madam Chair. To my next line of questioning: the Prime Minister and both the Minister of Finance, when she appeared before the select committee, had made claims around there being 240,000 more jobs over the forecast period. My question to the Minister is: how many jobs are as a result of that Government policy, and can she provide a specific breakdown of the policy and how many jobs will be created?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Those are just standard Treasury forecasts forecasting the jobs that will be in created in the economy over the forecast period.Hon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): Therefore, if that's the response from the Minister, we can surmise, therefore, that the Government's claim that they're creating those jobs is actually misleading. Therefore, I'm going to ask the Minister, since you've spoken about those particular 240,000 more jobs and that it's Treasury's forecast: is that, therefore, not the result of the working-age population actually growing by 250 percent? If not, provide a breakdown from Treasury as to why and how they got to 240,000.Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): It's sad, isn't it, when Opposition Members want to quibble about job creation—a thing that I thought both sides of the House could agree is one of the positive things that comes from a consistently growing economy, which is what the Treasury is forecasting and is the basis of that number.Hon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): It's, again, very interesting to see the modus operandi of this particular Minister of Finance. Instead of providing the detail—because, actually, that's the most important thing: if you want to make a claim that your Government is going to create 240,000 jobs, back it up. Therefore, when I am asking the question to provide the backup, to provide the breakdown—because, actually, my response is, that's only because of population growth—the Minister can only spin around and then basically push it back or what we call \"projection\" on to the Opposition for even asking the question in the first place. That is our job.Therefore, Minister, the question is, the number of people in work has dropped by 36,000 since you took office. Why should Kiwis feel confident about job growth when the number of people in work gets worse and worse?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): That member may take economic growth for granted. I don't, particularly when I think about what would happen if we had a Labour–Te Pāti Māori–Green Party Government that was targeting higher inflation, higher interest rates, and lower growth. There would be less job creation under that policy mix. To the member's question—she's asking about job creation—well, yes—\n\nRAWIRI WAITITI (Co-Leader—Te Pāti Māori): Point of order, Madam Chair. The Minister of Finance made a comment that Te Pāti Māori was in Government; we were never in Government with the Greens. CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): I think it was wishful thinking—just answering the member's point of order. But I was, while the Minister is actually seated at the moment and not asking a question, going to make the point to the Minister that it's not a session for political attacks; it's a session for asking the questions. Perhaps we'll just start getting things back in order.\n\nCHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green): E te Māngai, tēnā koe. Tēnā koutou e te Whare. I have a direct question for the Minister of Finance after having gone through all of the documents that have now been released over the past week that the Government was advised on with regard to this Budget. What do you call it, Minister, when the Government makes decisions that it is told will worsen homelessness, deepen child poverty, generate more crime, reduce the quality and quantity of higher education, and increase climate-changing emissions and then you decide to go ahead with all of those things anyway?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, Madam Chair, I'd just simply call that the Green Party's characterisations of the Government's policies.CHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green): I would refer members of the public who may be watching along at home to the official information and advice that was given to the Government about the impacts of the decisions that they were intending to make, because, in fact, the information is objective and it is clear.I guess, when this Government is provided with advice that the decisions it intends to make will do all of those negative things for our country and for our society, and the Minister refuses to answer about what that actually means about the shape of this Government, the question we're kind of left with—or, rather, the answer that we're left with—is that this Government is irresponsible or arrogant or, just frankly, incompetent. Is this supposed to be taken as a sign that this Government think that it knows better than everyone, including its own officials, including experts, including economists, including regular hard-working New Zealanders outside of these comfortable walls who can see the country falling apart around their ears as a result of this Government's decisions?Perhaps another question which I hope to get an answer on out of the Minister of Finance: knowing that that was the official advice—that so many things would get so much worse as a result of the Government's merciless cuts and the decisions that it was making—what analysis, if any, did she decide to undertake, perhaps with her social investment hat on, on the costs in the long term of all of these cuts to social service provision?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): I reject the member's characterisation, because, actually, I believe that this Government is pursuing policies that will deliver better housing affordability and less homelessness, in particular because we have the courage to address the underlying driver of unaffordable house prices in this country, which is restrictive green and red tape primarily through the Resource Management Act, which we are replacing—also because we are advancing the fast track regime, which will see subdivisions that that member would say no to go ahead, meaning more housing supply for the country. I reject the characterisation that we're increasing emissions when we've presented a thoughtful Emissions Reduction Plan which shows us achieving our zero carbon targets over that emissions period.To the member's question about cuts, I'd just remind her that we are running a deficit this year of $12 billion, which is one of the largest deficits of countries in the OECD and reflects the fact that the Government is taking a gradual path to fiscal consolidation, in which we are continuing to increase spending in health, in education, in law and order, and in critical public services because we think it's the right thing to do for Kiwi households, businesses, and the economy as a whole. If the member's position is that what the Government should do is just borrow ever more, tax ever more, and spend ever more, and that will solve every problem, I'll just say that I reject that view.CHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green): Just responding particularly to that point that the Minister made around the Government's Emissions Reduction Plan, the Minister herself—and, I'm sure, this House and members of the public—will be aware that the Government is currently being sued over its Emissions Reduction Plan because it's not actually worth the paper that it is written on. To that effect, the different decisions that we could see made in this House would be the likes of He Ara Anamata, the Greens' Emissions Reduction Plan, which would see emissions cut six times faster than the Government's so-called plan while reducing the cost of living and increasing quality of life.Another question for the Minister, particularly about our emissions—because there were actually some interesting comments made by her colleagues on a political panel at the Climate Change & Business Conference just yesterday in Tāmaki-makau-rau Auckland—is the Minister going to be budgeting for, or has there been any consideration whatsoever around budgeting for, meeting our Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement, particularly as necessary, unfortunately, for offshore mitigation, which becomes all the higher a cost as a result of the Government reducing its investment in onshore mitigation?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): I have to say, I welcome this member getting back to the environment, because I've never heard her so passionate on that subject. Normally, Palestine is what gets her more passionate. In terms of the specific question that she has asked, look, the Estimates clearly show that we are not forecasting spending billions of dollars offshore to meet the Nationally Determined Contributions which James Shaw signed us up to.To the second part of the question, is it a good thing that we are now in position where gas is diminishing in availability in this country, such that we're having to depend on a mountain of coal to keep the lights on? No, that's not ideal, and so I'd love to wind back time and not ban oil and gas, as Jacinda Ardern and the Greens did—that would be a better position—but, unfortunately, we can't wind back time. This Government is looking at what we can do to shore up confidence in oil and gas exploration.\n\nHon Dr MEGAN WOODS (Labour—Wigram): Just one question to the Minister of Finance based on her last comment: what is the average time in New Zealand for a new oil and gas field to come into production?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Off the top of my head, it can take up to six years, which imagine if they hadn't banned it—we'd have some new ones on score by now.Hon Dr Megan Woods: No, 10!Hon NICOLA WILLIS: Oh, it's 10 according to Megan Woods; I take her at her word.\n\nHon DAVID SEYMOUR (Associate Minister of Finance): Could it also be the case that, if you knock the stuffing out of an industry, the skilled people leave and the ability to keep production up is reduced in the short term?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, the member makes a good point, but the broader point here is that we have these tears on the other side of the Chamber about how long it's going to take to find gas, which has half the emissions of coal, when they're the ones that banned the gas exploration in the first place. This is a wonderful come-to-Muhammad moment, because, actually, the reality is that Megan Woods, the member who asked that question, was the one who went out there, banned oil and gas and set our electricity prices soaring, which led to a coal mountain at Huntly—well done.\n\nHon Dr MEGAN WOODS (Labour—Wigram): Thank you, Madam Chair. Given the Minister's comments that she's just made, which are factually incorrect in many ways, I'd just like to reiterate that the Labour Party has absolutely no intention of bringing back the ability to explore for oil and gas. But what I would like to ask the Minister is how much money was invested in existing New Zealand oil and gas fields between 2018 and 2023, since the Minister is talking about there being capital flight in her comments.CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): I think we're going backwards instead of forward. Is there a way the member can rephrase that question? Hon Dr MEGAN WOODS: Sure. So given the Minister has allowed two hundred million dollars to co-invest in oil and gas fields in the Budget that we are debating, what is the level of investment that happened—did she take advice on the level of investment that happened between 2018 and 2023, and how did that compare to the five years of investment in existing fields before that?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, I didn't take advice on this matter because, due to the management of conflicts of interest and in alignment with the Cabinet Manual, I was not involved in Cabinet discussions relating to this matter.\n\nCHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green): It felt appropriate to respond, given that the Minister, in attempting to answer my questions, threw back some quite nasty stuff. So I just want to make it crystal clear that genocide is a biodiversity and climate disaster—in fact, more military intervention and more war results in all the more climate-changing emissions, which result in an all the more unliveable planet for everybody, including New Zealanders. I also just wanted to further dig into the point that was raised by the Hon Dr Megan Woods, particularly about the decisions that this Government has chosen to undertake. The $200 million subsidy for new fossil fuel production in this country comes with an opportunity cost—Ryan Hamilton: It's not a subsidy—co-investment. CHLÖE SWARBRICK: To the point that is being heckled at me right now, I have put multiple Official Information Act requests, parliamentary written questions, and oral questions—both to Minster Todd McClay and to the Prime Minister—asking for any clear and explicit evidence that it is not a subsidy. Because, in fact, we have clear and explicit evidence that it is a subsidy. So can the Minister now stand and tell us that it is not a subsidy and provide the evidence behind that assertion? Because if not, in the absence of that evidence, it very clearly is a subsidy for new fossil fuel production. That's my first question. My second question is: did she, or her team, or anyone in Cabinet, do any form of investigation into the opportunity cost with investing this $200 million subsidy into new fossil fuel production, and what, for example, we could have achieved in terms of resilience in our energy system, with that money going into the likes of renewable energy?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Can I just sincerely say to the member that when it comes to the situation in Gaza, I think we can both agree that we are both equally appalled by the loss of life and the devastating events that are occurring there. For me, it's more about children dying than biodiversity, but I think we can both agree that we're both concerned by that.Now, in terms of the questions that are relating to the energy policy in the Budget, I'm going to invite the member to put those questions to Minister Bishop, who is the Minister who took those decisions on my behalf.\n\nHon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): Thank you, Madam Chair. Where I want to go with this line of questioning is in relation to reprioritisations, as the Minister would say. What we have seen progressively across the country since this Government came into power is a worsening of our public services and a health system that is increasingly under pressure. The question is: is meeting her fiscal objectives, as she has set out in the Budget documents, more important than funding the services that people need?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): We can do both.Hon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): Treasury advised that, in order to meet her fiscal strategy—and it was released under an Official Information Act request for a report that was dated December 2024. It was only released after a complaint to the Ombudsman. That advice said that, in order for the Minister to meet her fiscal strategy, it will require constraining expenditure growth—it will require \"significant structural changes to how these services are funded and delivered. All such choices rely on either reducing access to health and education services, an implied reduction in their quality, or historically large increases in productivity.\" Does this not explicitly say that she plans to degrade services in health and education?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): No, it doesn't say that, and I congratulate the member on catching up with a report that was first released around, I think, a month ago. What that report does is look 15 years ahead. What we set out very clearly in the forecasts that this Budget debate relates to is that, over the next four years, the Government will achieve its fiscal strategy by getting Government spending as a proportion of GDP down, getting the debt curve bending down, getting us back to surplus, and all the while increasing funding for health and education. We have left more than enough headroom over the next few Budgets to increase spending for health and education, and I'm quite happy to commit to that member that, for so long as I am finance Minister, there will be more funding for health and education. The hopeless scaremongering and the latter discovery of an OIA request doesn't make any of that untrue.Hon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): Therefore, in relation to the Minister's response, will the funding for health and education meet both inflation and population growth?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): I want first to acknowledge that Chris Bishop is in the House. Both Megan Woods and Chlöe Swarbrick put questions around oil and gas, which I think he will be happy to address, and it is appropriate that he probably does so at the appropriate juncture. In terms of funding for health and education, I'd note that the health funding that we provided in this Budget increases health spending as a proportion of GDP and, I understand, goes beyond demographic pressures. In terms of education, of course, that relates not just to the overall population but demographics in the age group of those going to school.Hon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): In summary of the Minister's response, is it correct, therefore, that she is not committing to increasing health funding by inflation and age demographics?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): No, that is not correct. I'm saying that there are different ways of measuring that, and I'm not going to be held to the member's way of measuring it. She's the one who'd measure inflation by making it go higher.Hon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): Therefore—because the Minister, again, likes to spin it and turn it around to attack members on this side of the House, as to comments that we've made, which is not her responsibility—will she confirm one more time for the record, for everybody else who is outside of this House, who are asking the same question, that while she if the Minister of Finance she will not be increasing health funding for both inflation and age demographics?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): I have literally just addressed that question.Hon Dr Megan Woods: Madam Chair?CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Is this a new question, because is Minister Bishop going to answer the previous question?Hon Dr Megan Woods: It's a new question.CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): OK, well we'll take the Hon Megan Woods first because it's probably on the same thing.\n\nHon Dr MEGAN WOODS (Labour—Wigram): No, it's not. I'd like to ask the Minister of Finance some questions around Working for Families and FamilyBoost. Minister, when you came to select committee, we heard that 153 families to date had received the maximum $75 that they were eligible for under FamilyBoost. What is the updated figure?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): I can confirm that every family who has applied for FamilyBoost has got the full entitlement to which they are entitled, which was based on the campaign commitments made by the National Party during the campaign.Hon Dr MEGAN WOODS (Labour—Wigram): I asked the Minister what the updated number was. We heard at select committee: 153 families had received that number. What is the number as of today?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, the member misses the point. I missed the characterisation in her question which is that the full entitlement is as she characterises it. Hon Barbara Edmonds: Check your notes.Hon NICOLA WILLIS: Actually, the policy has always been very clear—Barbara Edmonds—that the amount of rebate depends on how much people spend on childcare fees each fortnight. So they have to spend $300 a week to get the maximum a fortnight, and they have to earn under the maximum income threshold. So all families who meet those criteria have indeed got a rebate of $250. So the member's question is misleading in that it's claiming that it's only a full rebate if it is that amount, when, in fact, we were always clear that the rebate related to how much had been spent on childcare fees and the income level, and IRD have worked tirelessly—tirelessly—to ensure that people get the correct rebate according to their circumstances.\n\nCHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Can I just clarify, because I'm not sure that the member asked about the full rebate, so—Hon Dr MEGAN WOODS (Labour—Wigram): Speaking to your point, Madam Chair—not off our time—you're absolutely correct. I wasn't asking about the elusive $250 FamilyBoost; I was asking about how many families who had received up to the maximum of the FamilyBoost payment—CHAIRPERSON (Barbara Kuriger): Up to their maximum?Hon Dr MEGAN WOODS: Yeah, their maximum; 153 was the number that the Minister of Finance reported at select committee, and was the updated number as of today. If the Minister doesn't have that number, that's fine; we'll put the question in writing.Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, when you go back and check the Hansard, you'll see that the word \"maximum\" wasn't used in her earlier questions; she's inserted that later. I can confirm that more than 60,000 families have received their full entitlement for the FamilyBoost payment.\n\nHon CHRIS BISHOP (Minister of Housing): I do want to—I understand that—Hon Dr Megan Woods: The cavalry, huh?Hon CHRIS BISHOP: Well, I understand—well, you asked some questions, which I'm now here to answer. I wasn't here. So I'm happy to—[Interruptions] Well, you literally asked some questions. I'm now here to answer those questions. And we're now getting complaints about answering questions. [Interruption]DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! I understand Minister Bishop's come to answer some questions around the gas—Hon CHRIS BISHOP: Yeah. My understanding is there were some questions around the oil and gas contribution in the Budget in the Estimates. I'm happy to answer those questions and actually hear them, but I suspect I know what they are. From Chlöe Swarbrick there'll be the allegation it's a subsidy and possibly the same line of questioning from the Hon Megan Woods. The Government has set aside a contingency in Budget 20—Hon Dr Megan Woods: How can he answer questions when he doesn't even know what they are?DEPUTY SPEAKER: Well, he's referred to the fact that the questions were: is it a subsidy and the other question talked about the opportunity cost compared to energy and resilience. So if we make that the starting point.Hon CHRIS BISHOP: Oh, so having asked questions, you now don't want answers. Righto. Well, we now have an understanding of the Labour Party approach to everything, which is—[Interruption]DEPUTY SPEAKER: Quiet! Order! Order!Hon CHRIS BISHOP: —just speculate and fulminate wildly and then not actually want questions. A bit like their approach to inflation.Hon Dr Megan Woods: It's not the vibe of the thing; it's actually a question and answer.Hon CHRIS BISHOP: Ah, the vibe of the thing. Yes, a bit like the vibe of KiwiBuild building 100,000 houses, which that member was responsible for and was a disaster.So the Government has set aside $200 million in the Budget as a—[Interruption]DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, please! I can't hear!Hon CHRIS BISHOP: —contingency which will be drawn down upon the publication of a business case by the Minister for Resources. The reason the Government has set aside that money is because of the disastrous policies between 2018 and 2023. And it's a good faith attempt to deal with the lack of security of supply for gas in the New Zealand energy system. The simple reality is we need gas and we need people exploring for gas. Every member, I think, is familiar with the challenges around the insecurity of gas supply. So the Government has put $200 million aside so that Government can take a stake—Hon Dr Megan Woods: This is ridiculous. Are National so desperate they had to soak up time like this?Hon CHRIS BISHOP: The member literally asked questions.\n\nHon CHRIS BISHOP (Associate Minister of Finance): Which is that the Government has set aside this money so that we can become a potential co-investor in new gasfields to try and reduce the sovereign risk that has occurred to New Zealand because of the disastrous policies of the previous Government. Now, having repealed the oil and gas ban, we've got that into place, but there are clearly people out there in the world who look at New Zealand and say, \"Well, hang on a minute, if the cowboys on the other side get back in, what are we going to do?\" So we need an ability to make sure that people have some of their investments de-risked, and one way of doing that—and, frankly, if it was over to me, in a personal sense, we wouldn't be doing it, but one way of de-risking that investment is for the Crown to take a stake in oil- and gasfields, gasfields being the major focus, obviously; that being the cause of concern. So we are working our way through that between the Minister for Resources and myself, as Associate Minister of Finance, and when we have announcements to make, we will do that. It is not a subsidy, and it cannot be a subsidy if the Government has a commercial stake in a field. It's just—Chlöe Swarbrick: Yes, you can—yes, you can.Hon CHRIS BISHOP: Well, you're wrong about that, with respect—it's just an investment.\n\nCHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green): I'm really glad that the Minister is here now and engaging directly with this, because I would like to know and to understand what specific advice he has had with regard to the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade, and Sustainability (ACCTS), with regards to its definition of a subsidy. This is what I've been trying to get answers to over a series of months, in direct questions to the trade Minister, to the Prime Minister, in Official Information Act requests, and in parliamentary written questions—just to understand what the evidential basis is that allows the Minister to make those assertions that this is not a subsidy. Because the World Trade Organization defines a \"subsidy\", effectively, as a form of investment, whether that be co-investment or just taxpayer money being used and put into something that the private sector would not do by itself. By that definition, this is a subsidy. I would like to ask the Minister—I know that he's been dismissing, as many other Ministers in this Cabinet have been, the advice that we commissioned, because we have been unable to get access to anything that this Government has used to make its decision—whether he's engaged in or looked at the independent King's Counsel advice that we commissioned, in order to get some clarity around this definition of subsidy?Hon CHRIS BISHOP (Associate Minister of Finance): Sure, I'm happy to address that. It's a good question from the member. As I think the member well knows, the Government doesn't release privileged legal advice as a matter of course, so we won't be doing that. But let me just reason it for the member in this way: the Government owns 51 percent of Meridian Energy—it is a listed company, but the Government owns 51 percent of it—Meridian investing in a new wind farm, that is not a subsidy; that is just an investment. So if the Government sets up a separate company on the Crown balance sheet, as a Schedule 4 company, for example, or through another vehicle that's owned by the Crown, and the Crown takes a stake in a gasfield—say a 10 percent stake with a co-investment from a range of private sector partners—that is not a subsidy; that that's just an investment.It's the same as Meridian investing in a wind farm or Genesis investing in a particular type of power station or Kānoa investing in a range of infrastructure investments through the Regional Infrastructure Fund up and down the country, for example. The Crown investing in something is not a subsidy; it's just an investment. I know the member doesn't like gas, but she needs to divorce her views on gas from the basic—Ryan Hamilton: Maths. Hon CHRIS BISHOP: Yeah—basic maths and basic economics. CHLÖE SWARBRICK (Co-Leader—Green): Just further to that point, if I may, Madam Chair, I just want to be crystal clear with the Minister that this is not a matter of my personal opinion. This is about the definition of what is considered a fossil fuel subsidy under the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade, and Sustainability. All of my personal opinions about the need for us to act with pace to address the climate crisis aside, this is about, very literally, the words in a trade agreement which this Government championed signing, after five years of negotiation, with a press release from Minister Todd McClay in November of last year. In the advice that we have received—because, again, we are yet to get any insight into the evidentiary basis on which the Government is standing and consistently declaring this is not a subsidy—and the information that we have, is that this is a subsidy per article 4.3(2)(b)(i), because, firstly, \"the financial contribution\"—that being the subsidy under the definition of the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade, and Sustainability—\"is primarily targeting the … exploration, extraction, refining, [and] processing … of fossil fuels\", which the Minister would not disagree with. And secondly, because it \"reduces the costs of such activities or increases revenues retained by [the co-investors, who are the] actors engaged therein\". Based on those two premises, on those principles, this meets the definition of a subsidy under the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade, and Sustainability. So I'd just really like to understand how the Minister can consistently say the opposite, when he has not addressed the definition and the ACCTS.Hon CHRIS BISHOP (Associate Minister of Finance): Well, I don't have a huge amount more to add to what I've already said, which is, respectfully—and I appreciate that the member is engaging in this in good faith, and it is a complicated issue—the Government, via an investment vehicle that is owned by the Crown, investing in a new gasfield, alongside private sector co-investment, is just an investment. It would be different if the Government was going along and saying, \"We are going to pay you money in order to do something.\" We're not doing that. It's a co-investment on commercial terms, and that's the way—I mean, it's subject to detailed design, and we haven't yet drawn down the contingency, so I caveat my remarks by saying that, and Minister Jones is leading on this, alongside me, and working hard on that. But that's not the intention of the policy design and, therefore, it is not a subsidy. The Government remains really confident in its view that it is not. I know the member has legal advice to the contrary, but respectfully, we disagree.\n\nHon GINNY ANDERSEN (Labour): Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I have a couple of questions around jobs and economic growth in that space. According to the quarterly business employment data, there has been no job growth since the Minister took office. I'm just wondering if she's got any idea why there are 10,560 fewer jobs in the past three months?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): I'm very happy to take the member back to the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update, which forecast what unemployment would be at this time in the economy under the settings left by the last Government, and I'm happy to confirm that those numbers are higher than what has occurred under this Government.Hon GINNY ANDERSEN (Labour): Specifically, what is her plan for the 19,842 more 15- to 24-year-olds who no longer are in work? Is there any specific plan for that demographic, which seems to be disproportionately represented in the unemployment statistics that have been coming out month on month? I would also like to highlight that there have been 15 consecutive months now where jobs have fallen every quarter—and that is five quarters now—but my question is specific to the 19,842 more young people who no longer have work.Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): It's of concern to this Government to see any young person unemployed and on a benefit, because it's our view that every young person who cannot find a job should take up the State's generous provision of taxpayer-funded education that is available to them in the tertiary education system. When it comes to those aged 15, 16, and 17, they should be at school. When they are older, they are able to enter State-subsidised tertiary education of a range of different types, and that's why, in this Budget, we've advanced a policy for 18- and 19-year-olds where we've said, look, actually, we'd prefer that young people were either in work, training, or education and, if they're not, we actually want their parents ensuring that they take up those options. That is why we have put forward a policy to ensure that 18- and 19-year-olds don't automatically get a Jobseeker benefit but that their circumstances are tested against the income of their parents.Hon GINNY ANDERSEN (Labour): I'm just interested in her views on workers falling behind in terms of the cost of living. We know that there has been about a 1.5 percent increase in wages—that's not, clearly, keeping up with the 2.7 percent of inflation. On top of that, we have approximately a 10 percent increase in administrative inflation, which is all those additional fees and costs that Kiwis now have to bear, such as road-user charges, such as being able to go to tertiary institutions, such as going to a doctor—even the Government's commitment to help out and co-fund water infrastructure, which they've now backed out on, which is causing rates to go up. There's been all of these administrative charges on top of the fact that wages are only increasing at 1.5 percent. What is her response to working Kiwi families who find their weekly costs going up and up, and they do not have that extra money in their back pocket that she promised them?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): My response to those families is that this Government is working hard every day to get on top of the cost of living for you. That is why we are so focused on strengthening the fundamentals of this economy, because we understand that, when inflation is allowed to get out of control, that drives price increases across the economy that affect every family. That's why we target an inflation rate of 2 percent—between 1 and 3 percent, with 2 percent at the midpoint—and why we reject those who argue for a higher inflation rate that would lead to faster price increases and a higher cost of living. That is why, in this Budget, we advanced the Investment Boost policy, which we were advised would increase wage growth and increase growth in the economy, because we wish to see that. That's why we are on the side of businesses who wish to create jobs and who wish to lift incomes, and why we are so intent on reforms that will allow that to happen.Hon GINNY ANDERSEN (Labour): Does she accept that administered inflation last month hitting 10.8 percent has been done under her watch? Under her Government, we have seen increases to road-user charges, to all of those weekly fees that come into Kiwis' bank accounts. Will she accept that it is the cuts in Government spending, and pushing those costs out into the community for the weekly budget to pick up, that has actually made the cost of living crisis worse for those New Zealand families, and does she accept that all of those increased fees and levies have gone up under her watch?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): As I traversed in question time today, the biggest rise in administered costs is rates rises, and, actually, the decisions that individual councils make to increase their rates are their decisions. So, no, I don't take responsibility, for example, for Wellington City Council's rates increase, because, if I were leading that council, it would be a lot more careful with its money, which is why the Government is looking into our ability to, through legislation and policy, have a little bit more influence on the rates that councils levy. It is the case that, when rates go up as fast as they have in recent times, it has a very profound impact on the cost of living for New Zealanders. That's of great concern to this Government. It is that member's side of the House that have outright rejected doing anything to control rates rises.Hon GINNY ANDERSEN (Labour): Does she stand by her pre-election promise that National will co-invest in water infrastructure?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, we already are. The Regional Infrastructure Fund (RIF), under Shane Jones' watch, is investing in stopbanks and all sorts of protections for flooding and the like.\n\nCAMILLA BELICH (Labour): The Minister hasn't made any comments about pay equity yet, so I wanted to ask her: some recent documents have been made public on the pay equity changes. In those documents, officials said that, on their analysis of the proposals because of the short time frame, they raised concerns about unintended consequences. Today, we've only seen one union raise a pay equity claim. I want to ask her: was that an unintended consequence or an intended consequence, given that David Seymour has said that these pay equity changes saved her Budget?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, Mr we fully expect and expected that there will be claims made under the new pay equity regime, and such was the completeness of that expectation that I, in this Budget, have put aside funds in contingency needed to address future claims.CAMILLA BELICH (Labour): How much money has she put aside in contingency to address future claims?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, I would hope that that member would be informed enough to know that revealing that quantum would prejudice the Crown's negotiating position.\n\nHon MARK PATTERSON (NZ First): Minister, I note that, in one of your early answers, you referenced the increase to the KiwiSaver contributions that you brought in during Budget 2025. I've heard some other supportive commentary around that during the week and taking that even further, but could you give us your thinking behind why it's important that we grow our savings pool in this country?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Thank you, Mr Chair, for the question. Yes, that's right: this Budget supports a lift to 8 percent for KiwiSaver contributions from employers and employees. I'm aware that the leader of the member's own party has advocated for that to go further in future.It is the case that, when people contribute more to their KiwiSaver fund, that accumulates massively over time and can afford them a high living standard in retirement. It's also the case that countries that have private pension schemes of that sort have more capital available to be deployed in those economies. In New Zealand's case, with around 30 percent of KiwiSaver funds currently invested here in New Zealand, growing pools of KiwiSaver savings means that there could be more options in future for New Zealand - based investment in New Zealand - based jobs, growth, industry, and activity. I think that's a very good thing.\n\nINGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): Just some quick back and forth, if I may, Mr Chair. Does she accept that the cost pressures of the mental health sector are likely to be the same whether directly funded through Health New Zealand or in the funded sector; if so, how?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Sorry, can the member repeat the question?INGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): Does she accept that the cost pressures of the mental health sector are likely to be the same whether they are funded directly through Health New Zealand or whether they are funded as the funded sector, and, if so, how does she justify that there could be a difference in those cost pressures?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, it is simply the case that when the Government negotiates contracts with service providers, all sorts of factors go into the final price that the Government pays.INGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): Would she then expect that there would be modelling to be able to show—and evidence—what the difference in the cost pressures would be to justify the difference in uplifts?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, look, I think that these questions relate more specifically to Vote health, which the member in this Estimates debate will have the opportunity to address with the appropriate Minister. But what I'd say is that it's been the practice of successive Governments that we don't reveal information that would prejudice the Crown's commercial position.INGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): Would it be her expectation that the Minister in charge would have access to that modelling? I say these comments because we do have burnt out mental health sectors and we have people going to Australia; we have pay equity claims that have been cut in 33 sectors including mental health, so it's important to understand what level of evidence and modelling the Minister would find acceptable when approving the budgets from the health Minister.Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, I don't know what modelling the member is referring to; what I can say is that the overall funding uplift we provided for health was based on Treasury modelling about demographics and inflation. That was the modelling that informed Labour's commitments in their fiscal plan prior to the election. We exceeded those commitments and built on them further in this Budget—so we increased them even further. That despite that fact that forecast inflation is lower than was expected.\n\nHon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): Thank you, Mr Chair. Just going back to the Minister of Finance's response in relation to my question of whether she stands by her statement that she was advised on 24 February by the Secretary to the Treasury that employment discussions had commenced between Adrian Orr and the Reserve Bank board, I just want to confirm from the Minister: is it that she's not prepared to answer that question or she has not prepared to answer that question, given that this is on page 5 of the select committee report? So, again, I'll ask the question: does she stand by that statement?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Look, it's simply that I want to give an accurate answer. The member's put the question on notice, and I'm happy to address it when I can do so accurately.\n\nCAMILLA BELICH (Labour): Does the Minister have any plans to address the pay for care and support workers, given that she cancelled their claim and made it so they are unable to raise another claim until 2026, given that many of them are on the minimum wage now during a cost of living crisis?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Well, care and support workers, as with any workforce group, if they meet the criteria of the pay equity regime—which is a legal judgment and not a judgment for me to make—would be able to put forward a pay equity claim.\n\nINGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): Thank you—just a supplementary to that question from my colleague Camilla Belich. Has the Minister done any modelling on how many care and support workers from New Zealand, out of the 60,000 that have had their pay equity claim cut, have gone to Australia, given that a level 4 pay equity worker in New Zealand gets between $26 and $28 and in Australia can earn between $33 and $44, and given that the Australians gave an uplift of 30 percent over the last three years, compared to New Zealand?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): No, but I would observe that, across the economy, Australia is a wealthier economy that has grown faster than New Zealand for some years, which means it is in a position to pay its people more across many professions. That's why I have an aspiration to grow this economy faster, to have a more productive economy that can afford to pay its workers more. It's simply the case that wealthier countries pay their workers more. That's exactly why I want this to be a wealthier country.\n\nHon BARBARA EDMONDS (Labour—Mana): So, therefore, in relation to that response and in relation to her response during question time where she said that New Zealand's growth will outstrip Australia, will she therefore revisit her decision and ensure that if care and support workers—because the Government does the funding; an element of that funding—will she ensure that it's above the Australian growth? Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): I'd hope that that member would understand that it's going to take more than a year or two of faster growth than Australia for us to make up for the around 30 percent gap between Australia and New Zealand. We're going to need successive years of that. The best way to achieve that would be for Labour to never get elected ever again.\n\nCAMILLA BELICH (Labour): Given the Minister's answer in relation to pay equity claims, has she done any analysis about the value that giving low-paid workers pay equity claims would give back to the economy in terms of increased spending and how that may impact New Zealand's economic position?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): You can do whatever model you like, but if a country can't afford something and borrows forever to deliver it, then ultimately that country goes bankrupt.\n\nINGRID LEARY (Labour—Taieri): How does the Minister intend to fill the sector gaps in care and support work for an aging population when we already have a burnt-out workforce, we have workers going to Australia for higher pay, and we do not have immigration policies that will meet the demand and, in fact, are competing with Australia, which is why Australia have given a 30 percent uplift to their workers? How does the Minister plan to address that gap? Can she tell us how that is at all value for money and cost effective? And what immigration policies and other levers is she using given that we are not going to be able to get the workforce in our own country?Hon NICOLA WILLIS (Minister of Finance): Similar to this member's previous questions, she is asking what I think are important questions about the aged care sector and its workforce. Those are questions that are more appropriately put to the relevant Ministers of health in their Estimates debate.CHAIRPERSON (Greg O'Connor): Members, the Minister of Finance's time in the chair has come to an end. We now have the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. The Minister is available to speak to that portfolio from 4.13 p.m. until 5.13 p.m. I call Dr Parmjeet Parmar, but we'll just wait until the Minister is ensconced in his seat before we start our time. Thank you, Minister.\n\nCommerce and Consumer Affairs Dr PARMJEET PARMAR (Chairperson of the Economic Development, Science and Innovation Committee): Thank you, Mr Chair. As the chair of the Economic Development, Science and Innovation Committee, it's a pleasure to take the committee of the whole House through the hearing that we held with the Hon Scott Simpson, the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE). I'll just go through the main points that we discussed in the select committee. The select committee noted that the Government is seeking $303.3 million for the Commerce and Consumer Affairs appropriation, which is slightly below the previous year's estimated actual expenditure of $304.2 million.We focused on the Minister's strategic intention and it was quite clear that the Minister is quite focused on encouraging a lot of commercial activity, encouraging competition in commercial activity, so that our economy could grow. The Minister also mentioned that he is quite keen on seeing that we are able to provide easier access to capital. Along with these things, we also discussed various legislations which are in progress, some of which have been already passed like the Contracts of Insurance Act 2024. We discussed the Customer and Product Data Act 2025, Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Amendment Bill, and the review of the Companies Act, as well.In the review of the Commerce Commission discussion, questions were asked about the review that has been done, including the external review, and the Minister noted that the work that the Commerce Commission does is good, but it needs to be fit for purpose. Open banking was another topic where there was a lot of support from members on the committee, and there was a lot of interest to see how it's going to work. We heard that MBIE is actually formalising the regulatory system to enable open banking to happen. Charging fees for access to customer data was an issue that came up, and we noted in the committee that process is still under consideration. Changes to the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act came up. There was quite a bit of focus on retrospective changes there, and the Minister presented his side—the advice that the Minister had received—which led to that decision.Finally, in the short call, I would just like to highlight that another important issue that was discussed in the committee was about scams. This was to understand what the Minister is doing to reduce scam activities that happen which target people in all age groups, especially elderly people, as well. The Minister told the committee that this is something that needs to be looked at an international level and the Minister is keeping a very close eye on what's happening internationally so that we can see how we can also strengthen our anti-scam provisions here in New Zealand.So, overall, I would say that it was a really great hearing and I want to acknowledge the Minister, I want to acknowledge MBIE officials, and I also want to acknowledge all the members on the committee for really good scrutiny of the Minister and the officials. Thank you, Mr Chair.\n\nHon Dr DUNCAN WEBB (Labour—Christchurch Central): Just a couple of brief points, if I may. First of all, I'd be interested to know whether the Minister will be reinstituting the Consumer Advocacy Council that has been disbanded under this Government, which is a watchdog for consumers in the electricity market, given that electricity prices are skyrocketing and this Government isn't doing anything about it.I'd also be interested to know whether the Minister is going to correct his statement in the House when he said that there was \"overwhelmingly positive feedback\" about his PayWave initiative and whether, in fact, he is taking into account the three positive pieces of feedback or the 30 negative pieces of feedback about that. I'd be particularly interested to know whether he is reconsidering his position or what he is doing to ensure that the PayWave increases are not passed on to consumers. Does he agree with the feedback given to him that this is one of the most stupid moves any Government could make, or the feedback that said, \"less choice\", \"less personal responsibility\", \"more cost for me\", a \"badly thought-out populist policy\"? The point being that many consumers that he said were positive are, in fact, concerned that this current Government initiative will see PayWave fees pushed into the price of goods that all consumers will have to bear, and, in fact, it will be the opposite of transparent pricing; it will hide PayWave fees in prices.Hon SCOTT SIMPSON (Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs): In answer to the member's first question: no. But, look, on this side of the House, we take a range of feedback and balanced feedback from a range of sources. The member is referring to, I think, 30 pieces of interaction that I had received. Now, usually, in situations where there is going to be a positive change, there are sometimes those who are detractors, and I noticed that in his party, they are often detractors for positive change. So the short answer to his question is no, we're going to push on with the surcharge ban. We've said that it will be in place by May next year at the latest, but certainly earlier if we can do it, because New Zealanders deserve to have a regime and the confidence that the price they see for something on the shelf should be the price they pay at the checkout and at the till.\n\nREUBEN DAVIDSON (Labour—Christchurch East): Thank you, Mr Chair. On 20 May, the Minister quietly announced that the Government had decided to discharge the Digital Services Tax Bill from the legislative programme. As a result of taking this action, the forecast revenues from the introduction of a digital services tax no longer meet the criteria for inclusion in the Crown accounts. Reporting states that financial statements filed by tech firms including Google, Facebook, and Amazon show how they're moving their local profits to tax havens like Ireland, allowing them to declare little or no taxable revenue in New Zealand. Treasury's own Estimates were that a digital services tax would have pulled in $479 million from these firms over the next four years. Because of the Minister's decision, these firms will now continue paying minimal tax. Why, during a cost of living crisis and in the face of ongoing cuts to public services, is the Minister happy to write off $500 million in tax revenue?Hon SCOTT SIMPSON (Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs): With the greatest respect, the member just resuming his seat is a new member. He has entirely the wrong portfolio. These are questions to be put to the Minister of Revenue."
