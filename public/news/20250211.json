      "content": "The House debated an urgent public matter following the resignation of Margie Apa as Chief Executive of Health NZ and the Director of Public Health, highlighting concerns about leadership and accountability in the health sector. Government speakers argued that leadership must start at the top and pointed to substantial investment in front-line health services, including a record-level health budget and renewed targets, while opponents criticized the government for undermining health leadership and centralising control, warning that resignations reflect systemic issues. The next steps include continued scrutiny of Health NZ governance, a possible formal response to leadership questions, and ongoing management of the health system during the transition of responsibilities.",
