Leader of the Opposition Chris Hipkins challenged Prime Minister Christopher Luxon on his government's promise to reduce living costs, pointing to rising grocery prices and questioning the impact of tax relief policies. The Prime Minister defended his government's record, highlighting that overall inflation has fallen from a peak of 7.3% to 2.7% and arguing that interest rate cuts are providing relief to mortgage holders.

The legislation, prompted by the murder of Farzana Yaqubi, was strengthened in the select committee process to define a pattern of behaviour as two acts over two years, rather than the originally proposed three acts in one year. While the bill received broad support for providing better tools for police and protection for victims, Labour and the Greens raised concerns that the mental element required—that a stalker \"knows\" their behaviour causes distress—may be too difficult to prove and intend to propose amendments.",
