    "publicationDate": "2025-05-14",
    "summary": "Parliament was dominated by a fierce debate over the government's decision to repeal and replace pay equity laws, with the Opposition labelling it an 'economic backhanding' of women. The day also saw the announcement of a new $140 million fund to tackle school truancy, while the Green Party unveiled an alternative budget proposing significant tax increases, immediately drawing fire from government ministers.",

        "content": "The government faced a barrage of criticism over its changes to pay equity legislation, which extinguish 33 existing claims affecting an estimated 180,000 workers, predominantly women. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon defended the move, stating the previous system, enacted in 2020, had become a \"broken, unworkable, unaffordable system\" with unrealistic job comparisons, such as librarians being compared to fisheries officers. The government argues its new framework will be fairer and clearer. However, Leader of the Opposition Chris Hipkins accused the government of repealing protections it once supported simply because the cost was higher than anticipated, framing the move as a cut to the future pay of low-paid women to balance the budget.",

When you have librarians being compared to fisheries officers, when you have administration workers being compared to civil engineers, it needs some sorting out. We are deeply committed to pay equity, but the practice had become unworkable, unaffordable, and broken. We're fixing it, like everything."
