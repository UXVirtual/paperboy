    "headline": "Government Recommits Oil & Gas Bill, Pushes Through Contentious Electoral Law Changes Amid Heated Debate",
    "publicationDate": "2025-07-29",
    "summary": "Parliament was dominated by two major legislative battles today as the Government used an unusual procedure to recommit the Crown Minerals Amendment Bill to address oil and gas decommissioning liabilities. This occurred alongside the contentious first reading of the Electoral Amendment Bill, which seeks to end same-day voter enrolment, sparking fierce accusations of voter suppression from the Opposition.",

        "topic": "Crown Minerals Bill Recommitted to Address $2.5B Oil & Gas Decommissioning Liability",
        "content": "In a highly unusual move, the Government discharged the Crown Minerals Amendment Bill from its third reading and recommitted it to the committee stage to consider a substantial new amendment. Minister for Resources Shane Jones stated the change was necessary to close a \"loophole\" where companies could evade liability for decommissioning costs—estimated at over $2.5 billion—by transferring shares rather than the permit itself. The Opposition, led by Dr. Megan Woods, slammed the process, arguing the Government had secretly consulted with the oil and gas industry to water down taxpayer protections and replace clear statutory rules with broad ministerial discretion.",

        "content": "The Government's Electoral Amendment Bill passed its first reading amid fierce opposition, proposing to end same-day voter enrolment and require citizens to be enrolled 13 days before an election. Minister of Justice Paul Goldsmith argued the change was essential for delivering timely election results and managing administrative strain. However, the Opposition blasted the bill as a direct attack on democracy. Citing a damning Attorney-General's report, Labour's Dr. Duncan Webb warned the move would make it harder for hundreds of thousands to vote, disproportionately affecting renters, young people, Māori, and Pasifika communities. The bill, which also bans all sentenced prisoners from voting, passed 68-54 and now proceeds to the Justice Committee.",

Prime Minister Christopher Luxon defended the Government's move to ban surcharges on in-store debit and credit payments as a win for consumers. However, he faced sharp criticism from the Opposition for approving pay rises of up to 80% for Crown entity board directors while offering teachers and nurses increases below inflation. The Government pointed to its tax relief and FamilyBoost policies as key support measures, while Labour and the Greens highlighted rising demand at food banks as evidence that financial pressure on families remains severe.",

Minister of Justice Paul Goldsmith announced that vehicles registered to those with overdue fines may be clamped and seized by bailiffs. In an initial weekend trial at breath-testing stations, 4,859 vehicles were scanned, identifying 208 people with outstanding fines. The on-the-spot action resulted in 31 people paying their fines in full immediately, while one vehicle was seized and towed.
