    "publicationDate": "2025-07-29",
    "summary": "Parliament was dominated by the first reading of a contentious Electoral Amendment Bill, which seeks to tighten enrolment deadlines and ban all prisoners from voting, sparking accusations of voter suppression from opposition parties. The legislative push was set against a backdrop of fiery Question Time exchanges where the Government defended its economic record against intense scrutiny over the ongoing cost of living crisis, public sector pay, and corporate tax breaks.",

        "content": "The Government's Electoral Amendment Bill passed its first reading, initiating significant changes to New Zealand's voting laws. Key proposals include closing the electoral roll 13 days before election day, effectively ending same-day enrolment, and banning all sentenced prisoners from voting. Minister of Justice Paul Goldsmith argued the changes are necessary to ensure timelier election results, reduce administrative strain, and uphold the integrity of the system. However, the bill was met with fierce resistance from opposition parties, who labelled it a \"dark day for democracy.\" They argued the changes would disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of voters, disproportionately affecting renters, young people, Māori, and Pasifika communities, and represent an unjustified limitation on the fundamental right to vote.",

Around 110,000 enrolled or updated their enrolment details on election day last year only because they were told they could, so some people did. The message will be different this election. People will be told they need to be enrolled well before voting starts."

Leader of the Opposition Chris Hipkins challenged the Prime Minister on increasing pay for board directors by up to 80% while offering nurses and teachers a 1% pay rise, and providing tax breaks to a tobacco company. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon defended the director fee hikes as necessary for good governance of Crown entities and stated the tobacco policy was a health measure to help people quit smoking. Finance Minister Nicola Willis faced questions from Labour's Barbara Edmonds about rising demand at food banks, countering that official food price inflation has fallen significantly under the current government. The Government also highlighted its move to ban checkout surcharges on card payments as a key cost-saving measure for consumers.",

        "content": "In an unusual parliamentary move, the Crown Minerals Amendment Bill was discharged from its third reading and recommitted to the committee stage to consider a new amendment paper. The debate focused on changes to the decommissioning liability regime for the oil and gas industry. Minister for Resources Shane Jones argued the amendments close a loophole where liability could be escaped through share transfers, balancing taxpayer protection with the need to reinvigorate the sector. However, the Opposition heavily criticised the changes, arguing they weaken protections for New Zealand taxpayers against clean-up costs, estimated at $2.5 billion. They also condemned the process, stating the new amendments were drafted after confidential consultations with industry stakeholders while excluding iwi and environmental groups, and grant excessive and ill-defined discretionary power to ministers.",

The balance that we've sought to strike is to ensure that we don't provide an unnecessary level of risk to the revenue base of the Crown or at the same time we don't add to the chilling impact that has blighted this sector for quite some time."
