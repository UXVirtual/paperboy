    "summary": "Parliament was dominated by contentious legislation today, as the Government's bill to introduce tougher welfare sanctions passed its final reading against a storm of opposition. Meanwhile, a new bill to fast-track land acquisition for infrastructure was introduced, and ministers faced a barrage of questions over the recent cancellation of 33 pay equity claims affecting thousands of workers.",

        "topic": "Welfare Sanctions Bill Passes Third and Final Reading",
        "content": "The Social Security Amendment Bill, a cornerstone of the government's welfare policy, passed its third and final reading. The legislation introduces non-financial sanctions for beneficiaries who fail to meet their obligations, such as mandatory money management or community work experience, and requires jobseekers to reapply for their benefits every 26 weeks instead of annually. The Government argued the bill empowers people and supports them into work. Opposition parties strongly condemned the bill as punitive, cruel, and a move that will increase poverty and disproportionately harm Māori and vulnerable families.",

The changes also raise the threshold for what qualifies as a female-dominated workforce from 60% to 70%. Ministers defended the decision, stating it makes the system fairer and returns it to its original purpose. However, the Labour opposition accused the government of degrading the rights of women and using urgency to legislate the change primarily to achieve fiscal savings ahead of the budget.",

The bill proposes replacing landowner objections to the Environment Court with a streamlined submission process directly to the Minister.
