The Speaker's unprecedented decision to address the previous day's comment sparked a lengthy debate on parliamentary rules and decorum, overshadowing significant exchanges on the economy, education reform, and national identity during Question Time.",

        "content": "The day's most significant event saw Green Co-Leader Chlöe Swarbrick suspended from the House after refusing the Speaker's request to withdraw and apologise for calling 68 MPs 'spineless' during a debate on the previous day. Her refusal led to a vote (68-54) to suspend her, prompting an extended procedural debate. Opposition Leader Chris Hipkins argued the Speaker's action was unprecedented, citing a 2001 ruling that such matters end when a member leaves the chamber for the day. The Speaker defended his decision by invoking a 2017 ruling and stating a need to set a higher standard of conduct to combat political cyberbullying, though even government partner Winston Peters suggested the eviction was unwarranted.",

        "content": "During a heated Question Time, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon faced intense questioning from Opposition Leader Chris Hipkins about the struggling construction sector, which has seen 755 firms collapse in a year and 18,000 jobs lost. Luxon attributed the downturn to high interest rates inherited from the previous Labour government's spending, while defending his government's management and pointing to a $207 billion infrastructure pipeline. The Acting Minister of Finance reinforced this position, citing a Treasury report that blamed excessive COVID-19 stimulus spending by the former government for current economic challenges.",

The Minister promoted reforms like structured literacy in te reo Māori and replacing NCEA Level 1 with a Foundational Award as being aspirational for Māori learners. However, Maipi-Clarke voiced concerns from kura kaupapa Māori providers that the focus on standardisation over cultural relevance risks disengaging ākonga Māori and is not fit for purpose.",

        "content": "NZ First Leader Winston Peters raised another point of order regarding the use of 'Aotearoa' in parliamentary business, questioning the mandate to change the country's name from 'New Zealand'. The Speaker reiterated his previous rulings that since Māori is an official language, the use of 'Aotearoa' is acceptable. He stated the matter has been ruled on twice and should not be raised again, directing any further challenges to the Standing Orders Committee.",
