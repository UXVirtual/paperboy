        "content": "A significant portion of the day was consumed by the suspension of Green Party Co-Leader Chlöe Swarbrick. The Speaker demanded she withdraw and apologise for calling government members 'spineless' during a debate the previous day. Swarbrick refused, leading to a vote to suspend her from the House. The move sparked a prolonged procedural debate, with Opposition Leader Chris Hipkins arguing it was an unprecedented action for a comment made on a previous day. The Speaker defended his decision, citing a need to raise the standard of debate and combat what he termed 'cyberbullying' in political discourse, a move that drew both criticism and support from various parties.",

        "content": "During Question Time, Te Pāti Māori MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke intensely questioned Education Minister Erica Stanford on the impact of proposed education changes on Māori learners. The exchange focused on the replacement of NCEA Level 1 with a Foundational Award and the alleged banning of Māori words from junior teaching resources. Minister Stanford defended the reforms, arguing they set higher aspirations for Māori students and that new te reo Māori phonics resources were being introduced. However, Maipi-Clarke voiced concerns from kura kaupapa providers that the Government was prioritising standardisation over cultural relevance, potentially disengaging Māori students.",

Prime Minister Christopher Luxon defended his government's actions, blaming the previous administration's spending for high inflation and interest rates. He highlighted a $207 billion infrastructure pipeline, with $6 billion in projects slated to begin before Christmas, as evidence of his government's commitment to building and growth.

The Speaker defended its use, stating that as Māori is an official language, it is an acceptable name for Māori to use to identify the nation and has been for a long time. He advised Mr. Peters that the Standing Orders Committee was the appropriate venue to address the matter further, but reiterated that he had ruled on the issue twice and it should not be raised again.",
