    "summary": "The Government announced a major capital boost for Kiwibank, authorising it to raise up to $500 million to increase competition in the banking sector. In the House, heated exchanges during Question Time covered everything from nurse staffing and Palestinian statehood to rising unemployment and emergency housing. A general debate saw fierce arguments over voter enrolment laws and the Government's smokefree policies, while two members' bills on family violence evidence and pay transparency advanced through committee stage.",

        "content": "Finance Minister Nicola Willis announced that Kiwibank's parent company, Kiwi Group Capital, has been approved to raise up to $500 million from New Zealand professional investment groups. The move is a direct response to a Commerce Commission market study which found a lack of strong competition in the personal banking sector. Willis stated the capital could support up to $4 billion in business lending or $10 billion in home lending, creating significant competitive pressure on the major Australian-owned banks. She clarified this is not an asset sale, as all funds will go to Kiwibank for growth, with the Government retaining at least 51 percent ownership and safeguarding the bank's New Zealand identity through a Kiwi share.",

A future Government may choose to publicly list Kiwibank to raise further capital, but that won't occur without an electoral mandate."

Leader of the Opposition Chris Hipkins grilled the Prime Minister on rising unemployment, highlighting that over 400,000 New Zealanders are jobless or underemployed and that 18,000 construction jobs have been lost in the past year. Green Co-Leader Marama Davidson challenged the Government on nurse staffing shortages and pay offers that she claimed did not keep pace with the cost of living. The Prime Minister defended his Government's record, attributing economic challenges to the previous administration's 'reckless spending' and emphasizing record health funding and an increase of 2,100 nurses hired since taking office.",

The bill, sponsored by Labour's Camilla Belich, aims to make pay secrecy clauses in employment contracts unenforceable, allowing employees to discuss their pay without fear of reprisal. Supported by National, Labour, the Greens, and Te Pāti Māori, the bill is intended to promote pay transparency and help close gender and ethnic pay gaps. The ACT Party and New Zealand First opposed the bill, raising concerns about contract law, employee privacy, and potential harm to businesses, and attempted to pass numerous amendments which were all voted down.",
