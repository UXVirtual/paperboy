    "summary": "Parliament was dominated by economic debates today as the Government announced a $500 million capital injection for Kiwibank to challenge major banks. The move came as Prime Minister Christopher Luxon faced intense questioning over rising unemployment and the struggling construction sector. Tensions also flared over the ongoing nurses' strike, controversial electoral reforms, and the recognition of Palestinian statehood.",

        "content": "Finance Minister Nicola Willis announced the Government has approved a plan for Kiwibank's parent company to raise up to $500 million from New Zealand professional investment groups. The move, which follows a Commerce Commission recommendation, is designed to give Kiwibank the capital needed to become a stronger competitor against the 'big four' Australian-owned banks. Willis clarified this is not an asset sale, as all funds will be reinvested into the bank for growth, and the Government will maintain at least 51% ownership to safeguard its New Zealand identity.",

Hipkins challenged the Prime Minister on rising unemployment figures, which he stated were over 400,000, and the loss of 18,000 jobs in the construction sector since the Government took office. Luxon fiercely defended his government's economic plan, attributing the downturn to the previous Labour government's \"reckless spending\" and insisting that increased infrastructure investment would revive the construction industry.",
