    "summary": "Parliament was dominated by the fallout from Budget 2025, with fierce debate over the government's decision to remove $12.8 billion earmarked for future pay equity claims. Ministers defended their economic strategy, highlighting new business tax incentives and learning support, while facing intense scrutiny from the opposition on KiwiSaver costs, health system pressures, and a controversial new fund for gas exploration.",

        "content": "The most heated debate of the day centred on the government's decision to remove a $12.8 billion contingency for potential future pay equity settlements. Finance Minister Nicola Willis argued the move was necessary for fiscal responsibility, stating the previous pay equity regime was becoming divorced from actual sex-based discrimination and that adequate funding remains for future claims. The Labour opposition framed the decision as a direct cut to women's pay to fund the budget, with MP Barbara Edmonds highlighting the impact on low-paid workers in female-dominated sectors like aged care.",

The Greens' Chlöe Swarbrick pointed to Treasury advice suggesting this would suppress wage growth, as employers would offset the cost with lower pay rises. The Prime Minister dismissed these concerns, stating the costs could be absorbed within existing agency baselines and that the government's economic plan was successfully delivering wage growth higher than inflation.",

Increasing the employer-employee contribution is good because it makes New Zealanders wealthier and have bigger retirement balances."
