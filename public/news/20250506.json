    "publicationDate": "2025-05-06",
    "summary": "Parliament was dominated by a contentious government move to overhaul New Zealand's pay equity laws, with the Equal Pay Amendment Bill being introduced and pushed through its initial stages under urgency. The legislation, which cancels 33 active claims and makes it harder to file new ones, sparked fiery debate and accusations from the opposition that it is a \"war on women\" designed to fund tax cuts. The day also saw Parliament unite in a rare moment of cross-party consensus to pay tribute to the late Pope Francis.",

        "content": "The coalition government used urgency to introduce and pass the first and second readings of the Equal Pay Amendment Bill, a significant rewrite of laws aimed at closing the gender pay gap. The bill immediately discontinues 33 existing pay equity claims, forcing them to be re-filed under stricter new rules. Key changes include raising the threshold for a workforce to be considered 'female-dominated' from 60% to 70%, requiring this to be the case for 10 consecutive years, and removing automatic review clauses from settlements. Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety Brooke van Velden argued the changes are necessary to create a more \"robust, workable, and sustainable\" system focused on genuine sex-based discrimination. The opposition fiercely contested the bill and the lack of public consultation, calling it a shameful and disgraceful attack on workers' rights, designed to save billions for the upcoming Budget at the expense of women.",

However, he also acknowledged the changes would lead to lower costs for the government.
