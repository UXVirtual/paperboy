    "publicationDate": "2025-04-02",
    "summary": "Parliament was dominated by fiery exchanges as Prime Minister Christopher Luxon defended his government's record on healthcare and housing against sharp criticism from the Opposition. Lawmakers advanced significant legislation, passing a bill to increase competition in the building sector and holding a deeply divisive third reading debate on the repeal of Section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act. The day also saw key announcements on workplace health and safety reform and new measures to protect victims of crime.",

        "content": "A significant portion of Question Time was dedicated to the state of public services, with the Opposition grilling the Prime Minister on healthcare and housing. Leader of the Opposition Chris Hipkins challenged Christopher Luxon over long surgical waitlists in Nelson, attributing them to a government hiring freeze. Concurrently, Green Co-Leader Marama Davidson confronted the Prime Minister on reports from front-line organisations of a significant increase in rough sleeping, which she linked to recent changes in emergency accommodation policy. The Prime Minister staunchly defended his government's actions, denying a hiring freeze, citing a $17 billion increase in health spending, and asserting that support for those in need remains unchanged while blaming inherited backlogs for the issues.",

        "content": "The highly contentious Oranga Tamariki (Repeal of Section 7AA) Amendment Bill proceeded to its third reading, sparking an emotional and raw debate. Minister for Children Karen Chhour defended the repeal, arguing that Section 7AA had been misused, causing confusion and leading to decisions where a child's race was prioritised over their safety and wellbeing. Opposition speakers vehemently opposed the bill. Labour's Willow-Jean Prime labelled it a \"travesty\" driven by political ideology that will harm vulnerable Māori children and is a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The Green Party's Dr Lawrence Xu-Nan echoed this, stating there was no empirical evidence for the repeal and that it removes a key accountability mechanism for Oranga Tamariki.",

The bill, initiated by the previous Labour government, aims to achieve two key changes. Firstly, it amends the Crimes Act to prevent child victims under 12 from being questioned about consent in most sexual violence cases, increasing the maximum penalty for such offences to 20 years. Secondly, it alters name suppression settings, giving victims the power to agree or disagree to permanent name suppression for a convicted adult offender. While supporting the bill, Labour's Ginny Andersen raised concerns about the potential pressure this places on victims, especially in cases involving multiple victims or very young victims.",
