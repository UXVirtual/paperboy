    "headline": "Government Defends Controversial Pay Equity Law Change Amid Heated Debate on Survivor Redress",
    "publicationDate": "2025-05-13",
    "summary": "Parliament was dominated by two highly charged issues today as the Government defended its decision to urgently overhaul pay equity laws, cancelling dozens of claims, while simultaneously facing an emotional urgent debate over its refusal to create a new, independent redress scheme for survivors of abuse in state care. Question Time saw fiery exchanges over the pay equity changes, which the opposition claims were rushed through to save money at the expense of low-paid women. The afternoon was then consumed by a debate where the government's approach to compensating abuse survivors was labelled 'soul destroying' by critics.",

        "content": "The government faced intense questioning over its decision to repeal and replace parts of the pay equity law under urgency, a move that extinguished 33 active claims affecting an estimated 180,000 workers, many in female-dominated industries. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon defended the action, stating the previous law was \"unworkable and unaffordable\" and that moving with speed provided certainty. The Opposition and Greens accused the government of avoiding public scrutiny, cutting off pathways to fair pay for low-paid women, and failing to act in good faith on previously agreed backdated settlements.",

The government announced it would instead invest $774 million to improve the existing system. Minister Erica Stanford argued this approach would provide certainty and faster payments for survivors, stating a new complex system would be too expensive and time-consuming. Opposition parties and survivors condemned the decision as a broken promise, arguing that funnelling money into the very systems that failed them is re-traumatizing and unjust.",

This milestone, driven by a formula in the Act, signifies the fund is now large enough to begin covering some superannuation costs, which Willis said was occurring earlier than anticipated due to better-than-expected investment returns.
