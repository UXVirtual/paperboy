    "headline": "Te Pāti Māori MPs Suspension Debate Delayed Amidst Fierce Parliamentary Standoff",
    "publicationDate": "2025-05-20",
    "summary": "Parliament was consumed by a dramatic debate over proposed sanctions against Te Pāti Māori MPs, which was abruptly postponed until after the upcoming Budget. The day also saw fiery exchanges over the government's decision to scrap dozens of pay equity claims and the introduction of controversial legislation to retrospectively alter consumer credit law, impacting a major class-action lawsuit against two of the country's largest banks.",

        "content": "A recommendation from the Privileges Committee to suspend Te Pāti Māori co-leaders Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi for 21 days sparked a heated debate. The proposed sanction, for intimidating behaviour during a haka that disrupted a vote in November 2024, was labelled disproportionate by the Opposition, who proposed a 24-hour suspension instead. In a surprise move, the Government adjourned the debate until June 5, ensuring the MPs can participate in this week's Budget proceedings.",

        "content": "The Prime Minister faced intense questioning over the government's decision to extinguish 33 active pay equity claims, affecting hundreds of thousands of predominantly female workers. The Opposition alleges the move, legislated just before the Budget, was a cost-saving measure, while the government maintains it is fixing a system that was \"unworkable and unaffordable\". Further questions directed at the Finance Minister revealed uncertainty around how future pay equity claims from government-funded private sector employers, like hospice nurses, will be settled.",

The change would alter liability rules for lending disclosure breaches that occurred between 2015 and 2019, directly impacting an ongoing class-action lawsuit against ANZ and ASB involving over 180,000 customers.
