    "summary": "Parliament was dominated by an urgent debate on whether New Zealand should recognise a State of Palestine, sparking emotional exchanges over the nation's foreign policy stance. The heated debate followed a fiery Question Time where the Government and Opposition clashed over the economy, job losses, and the cost of living. The day also saw the introduction of new legislation aimed at cracking down on antisocial driving with tougher penalties, including vehicle forfeiture.",

        "content": "An urgent debate, prompted by Labour's Peeni Henare, centred on the Government's decision to wait until September to consider recognising a State of Palestine. Labour, the Greens, and Te Pāti Māori strongly condemned the delay, citing the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza and arguing New Zealand was falling behind its international partners. Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters defended the Government's position, stating it was a complex issue requiring a careful and judicious process, and criticised Labour for not taking the same action during its years in power. The debate saw Green Party Co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick ejected from the House after refusing to apologise for calling some government MPs \"spineless\".",

Hipkins questioned the Prime Minister on Finance Minister Nicola Willis's comment that newly unemployed people \"shouldn't take it personally\". Luxon defended the remark's context, attributing the economic hardship and job losses to the previous Labour government's spending, which he dubbed \"The Sixty-six Billion Dollar Man's\" legacy. The Opposition argued the government was out of touch and making things worse, while the Prime Minister maintained his government was focused on driving economic growth.",

Stanford argued the reforms were necessary to address issues with NCEA being overly flexible and inconsistent, citing hundreds of thousands of blank exam papers and a lack of teacher confidence in the system as evidence of its failure.",

The Government defended the move, with Minister Chris Bishop stating it was an urgent request from Waikato Regional Council to prevent over 2,500 farms from needing new resource consents.
