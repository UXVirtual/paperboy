        "content": "Following multiple questions on the issue, the House held an urgent debate on the Government's decision to consider recognizing a State of Palestine, with a final decision expected in September. Labour, the Greens, and Te Pāti Māori strongly advocated for immediate recognition, citing the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza and arguing New Zealand is falling behind its international partners. The Government, led by Foreign Minister Winston Peters, defended its cautious approach, stating that while recognition is a matter of \"when, not if,\" a careful and judicious process is required. Peters highlighted that the previous Labour government had six years to grant recognition but failed to do so.",

        "content": "Question Time was dominated by a bitter economic debate between the Government and the Opposition. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Acting Finance Minister Chris Bishop repeatedly blamed the previous Labour government's $66 billion COVID-19 response for the current recession, inflation, and rising unemployment. Opposition Leader Chris Hipkins fiercely challenged the Prime Minister on job losses, particularly in the construction sector, and accused the Finance Minister of being insensitive. The exchange was marked by sharp personal attacks, with Luxon labelling Hipkins 'The Sixty-six Billion Dollar Man'.",

The proposed changes include replacing NCEA Level 1 with a foundational skills award and introducing new certificates for Levels 2 and 3 that would require students to pass at least four subjects. A key feature of the reform is a return to clear marks out of 100 with grades such as A, B, or C. Stanford justified the overhaul by stating that \"warning lights have been flashing for some time,\" citing statistics showing low curriculum completion, high numbers of blank exam papers, and a lack of confidence in NCEA's reliability among teachers.",

Brown affirmed that IMPBs will continue to be 'powered up' to provide advice on the health needs of Māori directly to the Hauora Māori Advisory Committee. However, he was firm that their role does not extend to commissioning services, a function he stated belongs to Health New Zealand. Labour questioned whether this represented a minimisation of the boards' role and a failure to meet Te Tiriti o Waitangi obligations, a charge the Minister denied.",
