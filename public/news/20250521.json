    "publicationDate": "2025-05-21",
    "summary": "Parliament was consumed by a fiery pre-budget debate, with the Government facing accusations of sacrificing women's pay equity for tax cuts for landlords and corporations. The Opposition's attacks dominated a tense Question Time and General Debate. In a significant legislative move, Parliament also voted to scale back the requirement for tikanga Māori in legal education, while a contentious bill aimed at preventing banks from 'debanking' certain industries passed its first reading.",

        "content": "On the eve of the budget, Question Time and the General Debate were dominated by intense clashes over the Government's fiscal priorities. The Opposition repeatedly accused the Government of funding tax breaks for landlords, tobacco companies, and tech giants by halting future pay equity claims, which they argued would disproportionately harm hundreds of thousands of women workers. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Finance Minister Nicola Willis vehemently rejected these claims as \"scaremongering,\" insisting that the pay equity system remains intact and that fiscal discipline is necessary to fund tax relief for all working New Zealanders and restore economic stability.",

        "content": "Parliament voted to disallow regulations that required tikanga Māori to be taught as a component of every compulsory subject in a law degree. The motion, brought by National MP Joseph Mooney, followed a majority decision by the Regulations Review Committee, which deemed the rule an \"unusual and unexpected use\" of the Council of Legal Education's power. Proponents argued the move respects the distinct nature of tikanga and the discretion of law schools. Opponents, including Labour, the Greens, and Te Pāti Māori, condemned the decision as a misuse of parliamentary procedure and a significant step backward in the legal system's recognition of tikanga as the first law of New Zealand. Tikanga Māori will remain a stand-alone compulsory subject for law students.",

The committee's report draws attention to a narrow constitutional issue, not a cultural one. The role of tikanga Māori in our legal and education systems is rightly dealt with by the universities themselves, not through the backchannels of parliamentary disallowance."
