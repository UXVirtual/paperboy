    "summary": "Parliament's agenda was dominated by the final passage of the Government's contentious water services legislation, which opponents claim will lead to massive household rate increases. The day also featured fiery Question Time clashes over the cost of living and tax priorities, alongside debates on new bills aimed at limiting forestry conversions and modernising transport regulations.",

        "content": "The Government's 'Local Water Done Well' legislation passed its third and final reading, cementing the repeal of the previous Labour government's 'Three Waters' model. The new framework returns control of water assets to local councils, offering a range of service delivery models like council-controlled organisations (CCOs). Minister Casey Costello, speaking for the Government, argued the reforms maintain local ownership and provide councils with the tools for financially sustainable water services. However, the Opposition strongly condemned the move, with Labour, the Greens, and Te Pāti Māori warning that the fragmented model lacks economies of scale and will force councils to impose significant rate hikes on households, with some estimates suggesting increases of over $1,700 a year in certain districts.",

        "content": "Question Time saw Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Leader of the Opposition Chris Hipkins engage in a series of heated exchanges over the Government's economic priorities amidst the cost-of-living crisis. Hipkins repeatedly challenged the Prime Minister on decisions to provide tax cuts for landlords and tobacco companies while cutting funding for emergency housing and offering teachers a pay increase below inflation. Luxon defended his government's actions, stating they were fixing a \"failed legacy\" in housing by moving families out of motels and that tax relief was essential for low and middle-income workers. The debate grew tense over the framing of tobacco tax revenue changes, with Winston Peters accusing Labour of repeating a \"lie.\"",

        "content": "A bill designed to limit the conversion of productive farmland to exotic forestry for carbon credits passed its second reading, but with shifting support. The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Scheme—Forestry Conversion) Amendment Bill prevents exotic forests from being registered in the ETS on high-quality land (LUC classes 1-5) and caps it on moderately versatile land. The Government argued this strikes a crucial balance between food production, rural communities, and climate goals. While Labour offered qualified support, calling it a \"margin call\", the Green Party withdrew its earlier backing, arguing the bill is a \"dog's breakfast\" that fails to address the fundamental flaws of using unlimited forestry offsets in the Emissions Trading Scheme.",

        "content": "The Government announced its plan for the biggest changes to the building consent system in two decades, focused on shifting liability for defective work away from councils. Answering questions in the House, Building and Construction Minister Chris Penk outlined a move from the current 'joint and several liability' model to a 'proportionate liability' system. Under the current rules, councils can be held responsible for the full cost of fixing defects, even if they are only minimally at fault. The Government argues this makes councils risk-averse and slows down consenting. The new model aims to make builders, architects, and engineers liable only for their share of the blame, a move the Government says will hold \"cowboy builders\" accountable and speed up construction.",

The Regulatory Systems (Transport) Amendment Bill is an omnibus bill that includes numerous technical updates. Its most significant public-facing measure is the creation of a legal framework to introduce optional digital driver's licences in New Zealand, allowing drivers to use a digital version on their phones. The bill also moves to digitise vehicle registration, gives the NZ Transport Agency clearer powers to close State Highways for safety reasons, and corrects several minor drafting errors in existing transport law. Associate Minister of Transport James Meager described it as a \"dull but worthy\" bill that builds on the work of successive governments.",
