        "content": "The government successfully passed the final bills for its Local Water Done Well policy, which repeals the previous government's Three Waters model. Ministers argued the new framework restores local ownership and provides councils with flexible, financially sustainable tools to manage water services. However, the Opposition vehemently opposed the legislation, arguing it would lead to fragmented services and impose huge costs on households, citing projected annual increases of $900 in Christchurch and $1,700 in Hamilton.",

        "content": "A significant and fiery debate erupted over a last-minute government amendment to the Hauraki Gulf / Tīkapa Moana Marine Protection Bill. The changes create an exemption allowing a small number of commercial fishers (identified by the Minister as five) to continue ring-net fishing in two new high protection areas. The Opposition, led by the Green Party, slammed the move as undermining years of conservation work to benefit a handful of fishers for an estimated $14,000 in annual revenue. Minister of Conservation Tama Potaka defended the amendment as \"environmental pragmatism\" and a necessary compromise to ensure the bill's overall passage, which triples marine protection in the Gulf.",

        "content": "Minister for Building and Construction Chris Penk announced a significant reform of the building consent system, replacing the current \"joint and several liability\" model with \"proportionate liability\". The government's rationale is that this will reduce the financial risk on councils, who are often left liable for the full cost of defects even if only partially responsible, thereby speeding up the consenting process. The move was praised by groups like Local Government New Zealand and the New Zealand Certified Builders as a positive step for ratepayers and the industry.",

The debate highlighted that advocacy group Pay Equity Aotearoa has urged the United Nations to investigate whether the changes breach international conventions on women's rights. The Minister defended the changes, stating they are consistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act and that the process for achieving pay equity remains intact.",
