    "publicationDate": "2025-04-10",
    "summary": "Parliament has overwhelmingly rejected the contentious Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Bill in a decisive 112-11 vote, bringing a high-profile and divisive political debate to a close. The day also saw the government introduce major new legislation focused on education reform, fast-tracking medicine approvals, and ratifying a new free trade agreement with the United Arab Emirates, alongside heated exchanges during Question Time on Māori-Crown relations.",

        "content": "The ACT Party's Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Bill was defeated at its second reading by a vote of 112 to 11, with only ACT MPs voting in favour. The bill, which proposed to legislate a specific set of Treaty principles and put them to a public referendum, attracted a record-breaking number of public submissions, the vast majority in opposition. Proponent David Seymour argued the bill would provide constitutional certainty and ensure equal rights for all New Zealanders, confronting what he called the divisive idea of a \"partnership between races.\" Opponents from Labour, the Greens, and Te Pāti Māori condemned the bill as a \"grubby little deal\" that was divisive and based on a myth of Māori privilege. The government's coalition partners, National and New Zealand First, also voted against the bill, stating that while a debate on the Treaty's role is valid, this bill was a crude and simplistic way to handle a sensitive topic.",

Labour's Willie Jackson repeatedly challenged Minister for Māori Crown Relations, Tama Potaka, on whether relations had improved, citing the disestablishment of the Māori Health Authority and perceived undermining of te reo. In a separate line of questioning, Labour's Willow-Jean Prime grilled Education Minister Erica Stanford on her commitment to honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi in the education system, particularly regarding proposed legislative changes and the appointment of curriculum advisors. Minister Stanford defended the government's focus on lifting Māori student achievement as the primary way of honouring the Treaty.",

Minister Erica Stanford outlined key changes, including making educational achievement the \"paramount objective\" for school boards.

Furthermore, it introduces a requirement for universities to protect freedom of expression and for all schools to have an attendance management plan.

The deal also includes chapters on sustainable trade and Indigenous economic cooperation. The Labour Party supported the bill, acknowledging its bipartisan origins.

The Labour Party offered cautious support for the bill to proceed to the select committee stage, but stressed the need to ensure New Zealand's own high safety standards are not compromised and questioned the government's commitment given its removal of free prescriptions.",
