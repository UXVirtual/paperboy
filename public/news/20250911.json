  "headline": "Government Passes Budget Bills Amid Fierce Debate on Economic Growth, Job Losses, and Pay Equity",
  "publicationDate": "2025-09-11",
  "summary": "Parliament's focus was squarely on the economy as the Government passed its key budget legislation, championing a new 'Investment Boost' tax incentive to spur growth. The move was met with fierce resistance from opposition parties, who condemned the Government's record on rising unemployment, homelessness, and controversial changes to pay equity for 180,000 workers. The day also saw a major overhaul of the high school curriculum announced and tense exchanges over foreign policy and the detention of children in police cells.",

      "content": "The Government's Appropriation (2025/26 Estimates) Bill and a second Imprest Supply Bill, authorising a total of $59 billion in spending, passed their final readings. Minister of Finance Nicola Willis defended the Budget's centrepiece 'Investment Boost' policy—a tax incentive allowing businesses to deduct 20% of new asset costs—as a crucial driver for jobs and wage growth. In response, Labour and the Greens argued the Government's economic strategy has led to tens of thousands of job losses, a construction downturn, and rising homelessness, accusing the government of having no plan and delivering a budget on the backs of working women.",

The new subject list introduces more STEM-focused options like 'statistics and data science' and 'electronics and mechatronics', alongside new areas such as 'civics, politics, and philosophy' and 'Pacific studies'. A key feature is the introduction of strengthened, industry-led subjects like automotive and infrastructure engineering, which will allow students to graduate with both secondary and tertiary qualifications.",
