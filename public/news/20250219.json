  "summary": "Parliament scrambled through a busy afternoon of questions and debates, approving the Auckland Future Fund bill’s first reading and advancing several major policy measures. Lawmakers debated wage-theft protections, privacy-for-directors in company registers, a right-to-repair framework, and a Maori land public works bill, with cross-party support forming around some issues and sharp exchanges on others. The day underscored tensions between growth-focused governance and concerns over equity, privacy, and local government financing.",

      "content": "The Auckland Council (Auckland Future Fund) Bill was given its first reading, establishing a framework to govern the AFF and protecting its real value over time. The fund, capitalised initially at about $1.31 billion from Auckland Airport shares, is designed to diversify investments and deliver roughly $40 million annually to Auckland, with a target long-run return of 7.24% and 5.24% cash distributions. A 75% super-majority and proper consultation are required for any distributions outside normal parameters. Major speakers highlighted the bill’s potential to stabilise Auckland’s finances and support future infrastructure, while critics warned of local-government funding gaps and questioned the broader policy implications. The bill was sent to the Governance and Administration Committee for consideration.",

      "content": "In Committee, MPs debated New Zealand First’s Amendment Paper 243, which seeks to replace references to 'theft' with a formulation that includes 'without reasonable excuse' and aligns the new provision with existing criminal standards. The discussion centered on balancing penalties against employers who may mistakenly withhold pay, ensuring the law targets intentional wrongdoing without unduly burdening compliant businesses. The exchange also touched on the bill’s title and whether it accurately reflects its intent. The amendment was considered, with further questions about scope and enforcement as the clause 4 amendments were voted on and the bill moved toward reporting with amendments.",
