  "publicationDate": "2025-09-09",
  "summary": "Parliament was dominated by a major revelation from the Finance Minister regarding the resignation of the Reserve Bank Governor, admitting she was aware of an employment process months earlier than previously disclosed. The admission came during a fiery Question Time that also saw the coalition government grilled over contradictory housing policies and a heated debate on Palestinian statehood that descended into personal accusations. The day concluded with the formal commencement of the Estimates Debate, where the government's new budget faced its first round of intense scrutiny.",

Willis stated she was told Orr had been given a \"board statement of concern on his conduct.\" This information had previously been withheld under an Official Information Act request, which Willis defended as appropriate at the time to protect an ongoing employment matter, but judged it was now in the public interest to release following an Ombudsman's ruling.",

Green Co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick argued this constituted a fossil fuel subsidy that could violate international trade agreements, citing the definition in the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade, and Sustainability (ACCTS). Associate Finance Minister Chris Bishop defended the policy, insisting it was a commercial \"investment\" to de-risk New Zealand's energy supply and not a subsidy, comparing it to the Crown's existing ownership stake in energy companies.",

It's a co-investment on commercial terms... and, therefore, it is not a subsidy."
