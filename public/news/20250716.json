    "publicationDate": "2025-07-16",
    "summary": "Parliament was dominated by sharp economic clashes as the Government defended its record on jobs and infrastructure against Opposition criticism over a construction downturn and rising emigration. Amid the political sparring, two member's bills achieved significant milestones, with legislation to enhance protections for family violence victims and another to ban pay secrecy clauses both passing their second readings with cross-party support.",

The Employment Relations (Employee Remuneration Disclosure) Amendment Bill, sponsored by Labour's Camilla Belich, makes it unlawful for employers to take adverse action against employees who choose to discuss their pay. Proponents argued it is a vital tool for identifying and addressing gender and ethnic pay gaps, while opponents ACT and New Zealand First raised concerns about the sanctity of contract law.",

Opposition Leader Chris Hipkins highlighted a reported loss of 15,000 construction jobs and declining builder sentiment, accusing the government of taking projects off the market. The Prime Minister deflected blame, attributing the construction downturn to high interest rates inherited from the previous government and repeatedly challenging Labour to support the government's fast-track consenting legislation to stimulate growth and create jobs.",

However, it was opposed by all government coalition parties and Labour, who argued it was an ideologically driven and overly blunt measure that would undermine regional jobs and the economy, given that water bottling accounts for a minuscule fraction of total water extraction.",
