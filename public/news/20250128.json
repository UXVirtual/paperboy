He highlighted measures such as tax relief, reduced fuel taxes, and a forecast of falling interest rates, arguing these will boost jobs and living standards. The opposition responded with a scathing assessment of the government's performance, accusing it of mismanaging the economy, increasing debt, and pursuing a privatization agenda that could undermine public services, while parties across the spectrum defended their positions and challenged the government’s priorities. The session culminated in a formal opposition motion expressing no confidence in the government, signaling a heated, ongoing policy confrontation for the year ahead.",

Proponents argue the regime targets drug-impaired driving to reduce fatalities, while opponents—including some Greens and Te Pāti Māori—caution that impairment is not reliably indicated by drug concentration alone and call for more robust evidence and safeguards. The committee also discussed time limits for roadside testing and the balance between public safety and individual rights, with amendments to test criteria and a provision for independent laboratory evaluation.",

The bill also proposes exemptions for police processing in employment and aligns information-sharing frameworks. Debates focused on balancing privacy with public-interest archiving, the administrative burden for GLAM institutions, and the ongoing need for privacy safeguards in a data-driven economy.
